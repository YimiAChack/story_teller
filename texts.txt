S28E01_120#And that's where Lard Lad used to be!
S28E01_123#Oh, looks like we better file a report
S28E01_125#with the Bureau of Missing Statues.
S28E01_127#Yeah. Be like that time that Rodin statue got stolen.
S28E01_130#What was the name of that statue again?
S28E01_132#Ah, let me think.
S28E01_133#Thinkin'.
S28E01_135#Yeah, still thinkin'.
S28E01_137#Still thinkin'.
S28E01_140#Uh, either we can fan out and search,
S28E01_142#or bunch up and riot.
S28E01_144#Oh, balderdash and poppycock. I say we do not riot.
S28E01_146#Riot!
S28E01_148#Don't!
S28E01_149#Riot!
S28E01_150#Don't!
S28E01_152#Riot!
S28E01_165#And thanks to the equal number of nonrioters,
S28E01_168#the total cost of the damage is zero dollars.
S28E01_171#Homer, were you in that riot?
S28E01_172#Marge, please.
S28E01_174#I'm a leader in this community.
S28E01_176#In response to the outcry,
S28E01_178#Lard Lad's parent company,
S28E01_180#Tianjin Mining and Smelting and Donuts,
S28E01_181#has issued the following statement:
S28E01_184#"We are rebranding Lard Lad with an updated statue."
S28E01_187#Rebranding.
S28E01_189#That just means admitting failure, Dad.
S28E01_191#Admitting failure.
S28E01_193#People of Springfield,
S28E01_195#please welcome Mr....
S28E01_197#I know I'm gonna mangle this... Lee Fong.
S28E01_200#Uh, actually, it's pronounced Robert Chan.
S28E01_204#And now, please welcome the model for the original Lard Lad,
S28E01_207#Mr. Laird Lad.
S28E01_209#A lot of crazy names today.
S28E01_213#Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Lard Lad's bold,
S28E01_216#focus-grouped, new look!
S28E01_222#That doesn't say donuts!
S28E01_224#that says management overthink!
S28E01_226#The Thinker!
S28E01_228#That statue's called The Thinker.
S28E01_230#What? What are we on now?
S28E01_231#What?
S28E01_232#People, let's give the new statue a chance.
S28E01_235#When the Eiffel Tower was first built,
S28E01_237#many said it was a steel monstrosity.
S28E01_240#It still is.
S28E01_242#Fine, but maybe this will grow on you.
S28E01_245#- Aw, this thing sucks. - I don't think so.
S28E01_248#Well, at-at-at a certain angle...
S28E01_249#it's beautiful.
S28E01_250#- We love it. - That's beautiful.
S28E01_257#You fools!
S28E01_259#You've erected a massive concave reflective surface.
S28E01_262#It will focus the sun's beam in a deadly ray.
S28E01_283#- Yeah! - Yeah!
S28E01_299#First off, I'd like to thank the good people
S28E01_302#at Tianjin Smelting and Mining and Donuts and Tarps
S28E01_306#for neutralizing our wonderful, deadly, new Lard Lad.
S28E01_309#Yeah, that's great.
S28E01_311#They'll grow back.
S28E01_314#The time for mourning and blaming our mayors has passed.
S28E01_317#We will rebuild.
S28E01_319#We will rebuild.
S28E01_321#We will rebuild.
S28E01_323#We will rebuild!
S28E01_326#We will rebuild!
S28E01_336#We will rebuild.
S28E01_338#We will rebuild.
S28E01_340#I guess there's only one man we can turn to.
S28E01_342#Supergirl?!
S28E01_348#So... you'd like me to save the town.
S28E01_351#Well, you've got gumption, I'll give you that.
S28E01_353#And such an adorable baby,
S28E01_355#it really restores my... my faith in... in the, uh...
S28E01_358#Smithers, where is the damn trapdoor button?
S28E01_361#Mr. Burns, you already trap-doored us
S28E01_364#from your upstairs office.
S28E01_365#Yes.
S28E01_366#And how was your fall?
S28E01_368#Painful? Unexpected?
S28E01_370#- Oh, yeah. - Worst I've ever had.
S28E01_371#- Oh! Really... - Really...
S28E01_372#- Pulled something. - Totally painful.
S28E01_374#Did not see it coming.
S28E01_376#Excellent.
S28E01_380#So... remind me what I was saying no to.
S28E01_383#Funding repairs to the town.
S28E01_385#But if you could do even one little project.
S28E01_388#Reducking the duck pond
S28E01_390#or fixing up the Springfield Bowl.
S28E01_392#The Springfield Bowl.
S28E01_399#Very well.
S28E01_401#I will rebuild this town on one condition.
S28E01_403#Forget it.
S28E01_405#Our desperate plea is nonnegotiable.
S28E01_407#I want to put on a variety show at the Bowl.
S28E01_410#A celebration of everything wonderful about...
S28E01_412#what's the name of this town again?
S28E01_413#Springfield, sir.
S28E01_415#Yes, I will destroy Springfield.
S28E01_417#Celebrate, sir.
S28E01_419#Fine, we will try your way first.
S28E01_423#Springfield has risen from the ashes like a phoenix.
S28E01_425#That's phoenix, the mythical bird,
S28E01_428#not Phoenix, the cultureless, Mars-scape of the Southwest.
S28E01_431#Our unlikely angel,
S28E01_433#the devil himself, C. Montgomery Burns.
S28E01_435#Thank you, Kent.
S28E01_439#And don't forget the open auditions
S28E01_441#for my Springfield Follies.
S28E01_443#This year women may audition, too,
S28E01_444#with permission of husband,
S28E01_446#father and pastor in writing.
S28E01_449#Next.
S28E01_460#*Un bel di, vedremo*
S28E01_467#*Levarsi un fil di fumo*
S28E01_471#Puccini's a little well-trod, don't you think?
S28E01_475#This isn't right.
S28E01_477#This isn't how it was at all.
S28E01_479#I remember that night so vividly.
S28E01_485#Monty, time to go on stage.
S28E01_486#Yes, Mama.
S28E01_488#Your little butterscotch drop won't let you down.
S28E01_491#Aw, who's candy?
S28E01_492#You's candy.
S28E01_494#Oh, I'm gonna lick you, my sweet little lolly.
S28E01_496#Who likes Mommy's licks?
S28E01_498#Monty likes Mommy's licks.
S28E01_499#Lickity, lickity, lick.
S28E01_506#But the butterscotch soon turned to bitter squelch.
S28E01_509#I want everything just as it was back then.
S28E01_511#The stage filled with children
S28E01_512#like those from 1913.
S28E01_514#High-spirited, snaggletoothed,
S28E01_516#and willing to work 18 hours a day.
S28E01_517#Attention.
S28E01_520#An old man is prowling the school, looking for young children.
S28E01_522#Please, perform for him.
S28E01_525#Watch me make this nerd disappear.
S28E01_529#Also...
S28E01_531#Excellent villain.
S28E01_532#And my cast is complete.
S28E01_534#I'll just save the list and...
S28E01_539#Samson himself could not pry open these jaws.
S28E01_541#Can I help you, sir?
S28E01_543#Oh, women aren't meant for clasp opening.
S28E01_548#Young lady, if there's one thing I know about show business,
S28E01_551#it's that there are a lot of clipboards.
S28E01_553#How would you like to be my assistant director?
S28E01_557#And I'll be perfectly positioned
S28E01_559#to find out exactly what Mr. Burns is really up to.
S28E01_561#I'm in.
S28E01_563#And if you need another act,
S28E01_565#I also play this.
S28E01_566#There's no room in my show
S28E01_568#for Adolphe Sax's vile-sounding o-phone.
S28E01_571#Do you ever say anything in a simple way?
S28E01_572#Shut up.
S28E01_574#Well, that was clear.
S28E01_577#Hey, Homer, are you sure we haven't let the plant
S28E01_579#slip with Mr. Burns gone?
S28E01_581#Smitty, as a wise, old man once said,
S28E01_583#"Out with the old...
S28E01_585#and in with the brew."
S28E01_618#That's enough.
S28E01_620#But I haven't started my act.
S28E01_622#Muntz, what have you got?
S28E01_623#A rabbit in a bag.
S28E01_625#Ooh, a promising magic trick.
S28E01_627#No, it's my lunch.
S28E01_629#Bah! You're all incompetent.
S28E01_631#I won't go through this a second time.
S28E01_632#Second time?
S28E01_634#Is there something you're not telling us?
S28E01_635#A vast amount.
S28E01_637#And what part of "What I've never told you"
S28E01_639#Don't you understand?
S28E01_649#Mother, what is that sound they're making?
S28E01_650#Well, it's called laughter.
S28E01_652#You're a laughingstock, Charles.
S28E01_654#Oh, oh, it's awful.
S28E01_657#This show isn't good enough.
S28E01_659#No show could be good enough.
S28E01_661#It's not?
S28E01_670#What are you doing?
S28E01_672#Getting ready for Monday.
S28E01_675#I'm gonna fill a Super Soaker full of lemonade,
S28E01_677#Carl's gonna fill one with iced tea,
S28E01_679#and we're gonna Arnold Palmer Lenny
S28E01_681#when he walks in.
S28E01_686#Arnold Palmer Lenny.
S28E01_688#You're going to Arnold Palmer Lenny.
S28E01_692#Yeah, you see, Arnold Palmer was a golfer
S28E01_695#and he made up this drink
S28E01_697#where it's not a full glass of lemonade
S28E01_700#or a full glass of iced tea.
S28E01_702#Instead...
S28E01_704#Homie, I'm worried about all this silliness at work.
S28E01_707#You're the safety inspector.
S28E01_709#I'm a safety inspector.
S28E01_711#Not the.
S28E01_712#I've never seen another.
S28E01_714#What... wait, one safety inspector?
S28E01_716#For the whole nuclear plant?
S28E01_718#That's insane.
S28E01_721#Put everything in the car and get out of town.
S28E01_723#I'll find you, if there are still roads!
S28E01_725#Sweetie, sweetie,
S28E01_727#all you've got to do is be responsible.
S28E01_729#Your friends consider you the leader
S28E01_731#because you're a little taller.
S28E01_736#With above-average height comes above-average responsibility.
S28E01_739#Marge, thank you for setting me straight.
S28E01_741#You're welcome.
S28E01_744#Okay, I want to open this show
S28E01_746#with someone being shot into a cannon.
S28E01_750#You're joking, right?
S28E01_753#Well, because, see, that's impossible.
S28E01_762#Everyone, little miss nitpick hates the show,
S28E01_764#so I'm shutting it down.
S28E01_768#This was an act.
S28E01_769#Now it's just bullying.
S28E01_779#Thanks a lot, Lisa.
S28E01_781#We were getting out of school for this.
S28E01_787#Well if isn't the little girl that made a billionaire cry.
S28E01_789#May I please speak with Mr. Burns?
S28E01_791#No, he's very busy.
S28E01_795#Won't you please come back and do the show?
S28E01_797#Shan't.
S28E01_803#Oh, that bell has quite the recoil.
S28E01_806#Oh, what is bothering him?
S28E01_808#And what were those weird lines around his eyes?
S28E01_810#I know.
S28E01_812#It's such a tragedy on that beautiful face.
S28E01_815#Come here.
S28E01_817#Well, there's only one explanation for those lines, Lisa.
S28E01_820#He's been watching something on the Mutoscope.
S28E01_825#So, if I play this,
S28E01_827#I'll know the answer.
S28E01_829#It, uh, costs a nickel.
S28E01_854#So this is what made Mr. Burns the monster he is.
S28E01_858#Within days
S28E01_860#half of America was cranking to my bottom.
S28E01_863#I think you're trying to make up for what happened to you then
S28E01_865#by putting on a perfect Bowl show now.
S28E01_868#Spare me your amateur psychology.
S28E01_870#"Ooh, I saw my father decapitated by a grain harvester
S28E01_873#"And now I can't enjoy wheat. Boohoo."
S28E01_877#Mr. Burns, I want you to listen to that crowd.
S28E01_885#Do you really want to let those happy, joyous people win?
S28E01_894#Smithers, locate my dickey.
S28E01_895#We've got a show to do.
S28E01_897#*I was gonna clean my room*
S28E01_899#*Until I got high*
S28E01_902#*I was gonna get up and find the broom*
S28E01_904#*But then...*
S28E01_906#Springfield Nuclear.
S28E01_908#Yes, yes, sir, I'll alert the workers...
S28E01_910#that the pizzas are here!
S28E01_914#Oh, yeah, here he comes.
S28E01_916#The life of this party!
S28E01_919#Who wants to get back to work?
S28E01_921#What?
S28E01_924#We are a public trust.
S28E01_926#We bring power to people's homes.
S28E01_930#Lightbulbs, toasters, and that's all I can think of.
S28E01_933#Now let's buckle down!
S28E01_937#Okay, Homer, just let us get our microwave popcorn
S28E01_939#out of the core.
S28E01_940#You're only supposed to do that
S28E01_942#when we're watching a movie in the core.
S28E01_970#Thank you, thank you.
S28E01_971#Well, that's the easiest time
S28E01_973#anyone's had parking at the Springfield Bowl.
S28E01_976#Don't you laugh at me!
S28E01_979#Now, enjoy the show.
S28E01_982#God always liked you best.
S28E01_984#No, God loves everyone equally.
S28E01_987#That's wonderful news.
S28E01_990#Enough of your tomfoolery, Todd.
S28E01_992#Let's sing.
S28E01_994#*Michael, row your boat ashore*
S28E01_998#*Hallelujah*
S28E01_1001#*Michael, row your boat ashore*
S28E01_1004#*Hallelu...*
S28E01_1008#Say, Sockie, who was that lady I saw you with last night?
S28E01_1011#That was no lady.
S28E01_1013#That was your mother.
S28E01_1015#Oh, she'll date anyone.
S28E01_1017#Why won't she give me a stable home?
S28E01_1033#Um, this is just a simple twins trick.
S28E01_1035#They pulled the other twin out of the tank
S28E01_1037#behind the curtain.
S28E01_1046#Wait, that wasn't part of the show.
S28E01_1049#No. No, it's not fair!
S28E01_1051#I was good!
S28E01_1052#Arnold.
S28E01_1053#Palmer!
S28E01_1057#Fantastic.
S28E01_1059#What a finale, eh, Mr. Burns?
S28E01_1061#Childhood trauma cured, huh, huh?
S28E01_1064#That wasn't the finale.
S28E01_1071#Maestro, "Golden Slippers," if you please.
S28E01_1073#Ooh, boy.
S28E01_1080#We can't let him make a fool of himself again.
S28E01_1083#No, no, Mr. Burns needs to do this.
S28E01_1089#*Oh, dem golden slippers*
S28E01_1091#*Oh, dem gold...*
S28E01_1094#The burn.
S28E01_1096#Mr. Burns can't take the impact of that many photons.
S28E01_1099#Those light-shining fools!
S28E01_1108#Oh, for a murder of crows
S28E01_1111#to pluck out mine eyes!
S28E01_1112#You.
S28E01_1113#This show was your fault.
S28E01_1115#Well, you'd better know this, mister.
S28E01_1117#This town has my back.
S28E01_1118#And... hey.
S28E01_1120#Where did they go?
S28E01_1122#How did 15,000 people leave so fast?
S28E01_1126#Want to see me do a cartwheel?
S28E01_1132#Always had trouble with those.
S28E01_1135#Oh, I can't stay mad at you.
S28E01_1137#At my age, I can't stay anything at anybody.
S28E01_1139#Oh, and you know what?
S28E01_1141#The laughter in my head is gone.
S28E01_1143#Go ahead, blow your German kazoo.
S28E01_1145#Yes, sir!
S28E01_1150#Smithers, tap my foot for me.
S28E01_1152#With impatience.
S28E01_1154#Now, lift my arm so I can check my watch.
S28E01_1156#Oh, you really should start doing
S28E01_1157#some of these things yourself.
S28E01_1163#Dad, why do Simpsons always fail?
S28E01_1166#Oh, sweetie pie,
S28E01_1168#it's a terrible curse that goes back centuries.
S28E01_1172#No, no!
S28E01_1173#Don't answer that.
S28E01_1175#We just need a place to stay for the night.
S28E01_1178#Oh, shouldn't we help them?
S28E01_1180#Hey, in Zero BC, you can't trust anybody.
S28E01_1183#Curse them, Mary!
S28E01_1185#You curse them, my water just broke!
S28E01_1186#Please?
S28E01_1193#You're telling me that really happened?
S28E01_1195#They looked just like us, didn't they?
S28E01_1209#Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's all, folks!
S28E02_126#That is my family...people who love me.
S28E02_129#Yes, you're right.
S28E02_131#I should consider encasing people in plastic.
S28E02_133#Then I could always see the look of fear in their faces.
S28E02_136#Yeah, we're finished here. Get out.
S28E02_138#May I remind you I'm paying you five dollars an hour?
S28E02_140#Oi! Why did I lock in at that rate?
S28E02_148#What?
S28E02_153#Hmm. No pulse. Oh, wait, that's me.
S28E02_158#Dead. So sad. He was a true friend.
S28E02_162#Excellent.
S28E02_167#I can't believe Dr. Nussbaum's dead.
S28E02_170#Um, we've had a lot of therapists.
S28E02_173#Which one was he again?
S28E02_175#He was the one who helped us communicate.
S28E02_178#- You never listen to a word I say! - I have to listen all day at work.
S28E02_181#- You're not listening now. - I'm listened out!
S28E02_182#- What? "Listened out." - Not listening...
S28E02_184#- What does that even mean? - Not listening,  
S28E02_186#Let's hear what the children have to say.
S28E02_188#- I'm gonna wet the bed to get their attention. - Not listening...
S28E02_190#You're the one sleeping in it.
S28E02_192#I didn't say I'd wet my bed.
S28E02_194#Please, Marge! Do we have to burden
S28E02_196#Dr. Nussbaum with our problems?
S28E02_198#- Maggie talk! - The man has problems of his own!
S28E02_200#Maggie talk!
S28E02_204#No one listen? Maggie never talk again.
S28E02_208#- That's not what happened. - That's exactly what happened.
S28E02_210#I believe I remember what happened, Marge. - How could you remember?
S28E02_213#You were looking at your phone half the time.
S28E02_215#When you have four bar Wi-Fi, you use it!
S28E02_218#Oh, look. It's the ugly people from the cube.
S28E02_220#Uh, if we can begin.
S28E02_222#Oh, of course.
S28E02_224#Oh, this man meant a great deal to me.
S28E02_226#And helping out with the cost of this service 
S28E02_227#was the least I could do.
S28E02_228#Very sweet.
S28E02_229#Smithers?
S28E02_234#For shame!
S28E02_243#Stoned at a funeral.
S28E02_245#Ooh, wow! Where's the funeral?
S28E02_249#Oh! Just what I wanted.
S28E02_251#Just get me home quickly.
S28E02_259#And this year's Nobel Prize for Physics goes to...
S28E02_262#Professor John Frink.
S28E02_271#Ah, thank you, Queen Sonya, and all the people at HBO...
S28E02_274#the, uh, Higgs Boson Observatory.
S28E02_276#You'll see there.
S28E02_278#Oi! Oiven!
S28E02_280#I-I didn't mean to hit him, sir.
S28E02_282#Well, how could a man in his right mind
S28E02_284#miss a car heading right towards him?
S28E02_286#Idiot!
S28E02_288#I think it's this headpiece he's wearing, sir.
S28E02_291#If I may ask, what makes this device so enchanting
S28E02_294#that you ignore the real world?
S28E02_296#Is there a milkmaid skipping rope?
S28E02_302#Oi! Gloivick!
S28E02_304#The Oculus Frink... or Froculus...
S28E02_308#provides you with a complete virtual reality experience.
S28E02_311#Letting you live in a world of your dreams.
S28E02_319#To adjust the focus, turn the dial on the side.
S28E02_325#Now for the after-party!
S28E02_335#I must have it!
S28E02_337#Oh, uh, can you drop me off first?
S28E02_354#Not bad. Next?
S28E02_356#This is still a new technology, sir.
S28E02_358#At the moment, it's really just lots of pornography,
S28E02_361#a roller coaster, pornography, pornography,
S28E02_363#Burger King ad, pornography,
S28E02_364#and... and this one.
S28E02_376#Dragon porn.
S28E02_381#Oh, flame on, baby.
S28E02_382#Flame on!
S28E02_383#Hot! Hot!
S28E02_385#Don't tell my wife, okay?
S28E02_386#Oh, sorry, sir.
S28E02_388#This one is also pornography.
S28E02_389#Oh, so boring.
S28E02_392#Trim those nails, Smithers.
S28E02_394#Uh, sir, if I might suggest,
S28E02_396#the last thing your therapist said was,
S28E02_398#"You need a family."
S28E02_400#I don't need anyone.
S28E02_402#We could program a virtual family for you, sir.
S28E02_406#A virtual family. Yes.
S28E02_407#Meanwhile, let me see the one again
S28E02_409#where I shoot the beloved lion in Africa.
S28E02_411#That was reality, sir.
S28E02_413#I've lived quite the life.
S28E02_415#Quite the life.
S28E02_420#We only need three children, thanks.
S28E02_422#Oh, what kind of coal mine you runnin'?
S28E02_426#You, wife, look at me lovingly,
S28E02_429#as if I'm your husband.
S28E02_431#Can you ask for a look of indifference?
S28E02_433#I think she can do that.
S28E02_435#Luann, pretend it's my birthday.
S28E02_437#Next.
S28E02_439#You promised me a job, Dad!
S28E02_441#I was gonna buy a fat Barbie.
S28E02_443#It's Curvy Barbie.
S28E02_445#And that would mean you have to buy all new clothes.
S28E02_449#This thing says all families in the plant
S28E02_451#are required to try out.
S28E02_452#So far, so good.
S28E02_454#Two-and-a-half children, wife with current hairstyle.
S28E02_456#You're all hired.
S28E02_458#Except you, fatso. We don't need a father.
S28E02_460#I'll be the rooster in this henhouse.
S28E02_462#That is so disappointing.
S28E02_464#I've always wanted to work for Mr. Burns.
S28E02_470#Okay, family scene.
S28E02_472#And... action.
S28E02_486#This isn't a word I use lightly, but... excellent.
S28E02_489#Oh, Smithers, one favor:
S28E02_491#make the children look like they're mine.
S28E02_495#No, no, no! It's too beautiful.
S28E02_498#Like a Supreme Court full of Scalias.
S28E02_499#Switch to something else.
S28E02_507#That's good.
S28E02_508#What's the matter, Homer?
S28E02_510#Last night, Marge and the kids
S28E02_512#didn't get home till 11:00 at night.
S28E02_514#When I came back from Moe's at 11:05,
S28E02_516#they were still taking off their coats!
S28E02_519#I hear old man Burns is just living in a fantasy world now.
S28E02_521#En garde!
S28E02_523#Must be nice.
S28E02_525#Hey, there he is. Wonder what he's watching now.
S28E02_527#Home movies.
S28E02_531#*Happy birthday, dear Burnsie*
S28E02_536#*Happy birthday to you*
S28E02_540#*And maybe more*
S28E02_542#Thank you, thank you.
S28E02_544#Now, your mother's going to take me upstairs
S28E02_546#to give me... her present.
S28E02_553#Oh, Smithers, could you remove the ankle bar?
S28E02_556#More. More. More.
S28E02_562#That was wonderful.
S28E02_564#I'm picking up your ten-year options.
S28E02_566#Ten years?!
S28E02_568#Oh, now, now, no discussion.
S28E02_570#We're a family now.
S28E02_573#What is that? A river otter?
S28E02_580#We're not coming home, Homie.
S28E02_582#What? What do I do without you here?
S28E02_585#You can do what you did with me there: 
S28E02_587#go to Moe's.
S28E02_588#Aw, it's not the same
S28E02_590#if I'm not trying to avoid some unpleasant chore.
S28E02_593#Oh. You could clean out the attic.
S28E02_594#Going to Moe's!
S28E02_597#Eh, no one to go home to, huh?
S28E02_599#Yeah, take it from me, that's rough.
S28E02_600#Yeah.
S28E02_602#Heading back to an empty house.
S28E02_604#No one there to tell you what to do,
S28E02_605#no kids fighting all the time.
S28E02_607#Wait a minute.
S28E02_609#I can eat dinner in any room of the house!
S28E02_611#And not the scary ones like the basement and Bart's bedroom.
S28E02_614#And I can drink at home!
S28E02_616#Whoa, whoa! You're twisting my words there.
S28E02_618#That would be cheaper! And I wouldn't have to drive!
S28E02_620#And you are kind of mean.
S28E02_622#No one calls me mean.
S28E02_626#Moe, you're proving my point.
S28E02_628#Here we are talking, and you pull a shotgun on me.
S28E02_630#But there's never any bullets in this. Watch.
S28E02_634#Ha! Good gag, huh?
S28E02_694#Mmm, does that turn you on?
S28E02_696#Oh, yes. That's hot.
S28E02_700#The perfect temperature.
S28E02_706#Ah, Snoopy knew what he was doing, all right.
S28E02_708#How you doing?
S28E02_711#Don't worry, I've seen you naked plenty of times.
S28E02_714#I live in the house behind yours.
S28E02_716#I don't think my wife would like this.
S28E02_718#Hey, I got a boyfriend, 
S28E02_720#and you're not my type.
S28E02_721#Could you both keep it down?
S28E02_722#I'm trying to count pennies.
S28E02_725#Stupid Flanders.
S28E02_727#Oh! You made me lose count.
S28E02_731#Homer, it looks like you're out of beer, pal.
S28E02_736#Wow, can a man just be friends with a woman?
S28E02_738#Here are some pretzels.
S28E02_740#Yes, he can!
S28E02_746#Aw, don't worry. I'll fix that.
S28E02_749#Have one. I'm celebrating.
S28E02_751#My boyfriend proposed.
S28E02_754#Wow! You'll get to enjoy the most magical part of married life: 
S28E02_757#the beginning.
S28E02_761#So, uh, where's the lucky guy?
S28E02_763#Gone for the weekend.
S28E02_764#He's an airline pilot.
S28E02_766#Maybe he and I can go out for beers - before a flight. 
S28E02_769#Where's your wife?
S28E02_771#Uh, she's staying at this billionaire's house,
S28E02_774#working as a virtual reality actress.
S28E02_775#You know, the usual.
S28E02_777#Oh, Homer?
S28E02_779#Something's going on with Homer.
S28E02_781#My spousal sense is tingling.
S28E02_783#Mom, you blew the take!
S28E02_785#Okay, that's it. I'll direct.
S28E02_787#And I'll show you how a pro does it.
S28E02_789#You, daughter character, say you love me.
S28E02_790#I love you.
S28E02_791#Like you mean it.
S28E02_793#I really love you.
S28E02_794#Once more, with feeling.
S28E02_798#I... really... love... you.
S28E02_803#This girl has no chops whatsoever.
S28E02_805#The existence of my chops
S28E02_807#is not for the likes of you to ascertain, my good sir.
S28E02_811#Would you like some eggs with that ham?
S28E02_819#Looks like the old make-out king's got a new queen, huh?
S28E02_822#Guys, we're just friends.
S28E02_824#It's purely catatonic.
S28E02_825#"Platonic."
S28E02_827#That means she's into me, but I'm keeping it cool.
S28E02_830#I like you, but that's not what it means.
S28E02_833#Sure, right.
S28E02_836#Here you go, the antipasto, to share.
S28E02_841#Would you fellas like to join us?
S28E02_845#When did salad get so awful?
S28E02_848#Kale ruined everything.
S28E02_851#You're just like a guy.
S28E02_853#You're funny, you like to eat crap.
S28E02_855#If I may get personal,
S28E02_857#- what's your bowling average? - 212.
S28E02_860#Oh, my God, you're my best friend!
S28E02_862#And that's all. Just friends.
S28E02_864#Eh, we shall see.
S28E02_867#There is one test for a-romance that never fails.
S28E02_870#Enjoy it.
S28E02_877#That is not a-love!
S28E02_880#This is the best... we're friends,
S28E02_882#no one has any reason to get upset,
S28E02_883#and no one gets hurt.
S28E02_885#To no one getting hurt.
S28E02_887#Smash-cut to Marge!
S28E02_889#"Look, Monty, our daughter, the president,
S28E02_891#is delivering her speech."
S28E02_893#Excuse me, do I ever get a joke?
S28E02_895#Keep rolling.
S28E02_898#"Mr. Vice President, Madam Speaker, Chinese Overlords,
S28E02_902#years ago, our forefathers, and foremothers..."
S28E02_905#Stick to the script!
S28E02_907#Oh, you try to give direction to a bunch of land apes
S28E02_909#who aren't worth the ping-pong balls
S28E02_912#stuck to their untalented asses!
S28E02_914#Idiots! Mountebanks!
S28E02_916#Featherwits! Poltroons!
S28E02_919#Saint Francis himself would vomit with rage!
S28E02_923#Okay, you heard him, people.
S28E02_925#That was great, just a little more energy.
S28E02_927#Sir, I know you're getting frustrated,
S28E02_929#so we recorded some future scenarios.
S28E02_931#Yes, let's see what life will be like when I'm old.
S28E02_934#I'm going to build homes for the homeless
S28E02_937#with my boyfriend Sean,
S28E02_939#then it's off to Vassar in the fall.
S28E02_941#Irish boyfriend? Helping the homeless?
S28E02_944#Well, every family has one black sheep.
S28E02_945#Let's move on.
S28E02_947#How did this happen?
S28E02_950#Don't you take that tone with me.
S28E02_953#A Harvard man?
S28E02_955#I was warned there'd be nausea.
S28E02_957#I don't need them. My life is perfect.
S28E02_962#My life is perfect.
S28E02_965#49, 50. My life is perfect!
S28E02_968#Have you seen my Canadian penny?
S28E02_971#Oh, darn it, darn it, darn it!
S28E02_974#Everyone out! You're all fired!
S28E02_977#Having a family is the most meaningless experience
S28E02_978#I could imagine.
S28E02_980#Try acting.
S28E02_982#Come on, kids.
S28E02_983#I'm taking my bathrobe.
S28E02_985#There's a dye pack stitched in.
S28E02_988#Joke's on you. I like this better.
S28E02_990#Oh, go ahead, take your robe.
S28E02_991#But you'll never work in
S28E02_993#single-viewer virtual reality family melodrama again.
S28E02_997#Did you see the guitar lessons sign on the telephone pole?
S28E02_1000#I took a tab.
S28E02_1002#No, I'm not gonna take the lessons,
S28E02_1004#I just needed to blow my nose.
S28E02_1006#Ooh, my family's here. Gotta go.
S28E02_1008#Hey, guys! It's good to see you.
S28E02_1010#Hmm. Good to see you. Who were you talking to?
S28E02_1013#My friend Julia.
S28E02_1015#- Julia? Like a girl? - She's not a girl.
S28E02_1018#She's three years younger than your mother.
S28E02_1021#Now, Marge, it's cool.
S28E02_1023#All we do is share our deepest thoughts and feelings.
S28E02_1027#Kids, could you leave the room, please?
S28E02_1030#Faster!
S28E02_1032#Geronimo!
S28E02_1036#Marge, it's nothing. She's just my new best friend.
S28E02_1042#What the... Why... Why are you mad at those eggs?!
S28E02_1044#They didn't do anything!
S28E02_1047#Homer Simpson!
S28E02_1050#After all I've put up with for all these years,
S28E02_1054#if I'm not your best friend, what is this marriage about?!
S28E02_1057#Okay, okay, you're my best friend.
S28E02_1059#She's just somebody I call when I'm mad at you.
S28E02_1063#I mean, I'm never mad at you.
S28E02_1064#Well, sometimes I'm mad at you.
S28E02_1066#A little bit! But I shouldn't call her.
S28E02_1069#I should just drink it off at Moe's.
S28E02_1071#You'll never hear the name Julia again.
S28E02_1074#Hi, I'm Julia.
S28E02_1076#I just wanted to introduce myself 
S28E02_1078#and tell you you've got a great husband.
S28E02_1081#I've got a nice bicycle, too, but I keep a lock on it.
S28E02_1085#I have no interest in... riding your bike.
S28E02_1088#But I want you to know that your bike loves you
S28E02_1091#as truly as a bike can.
S28E02_1093#And, Marge, I love you as much as that bike.
S28E02_1097#- You are the bike. - Wha...?!
S28E02_1103#I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
S28E02_1105#Apparently, you didn't do anything wrong.
S28E02_1108#But I'm not wrong for getting mad at you either.
S28E02_1111#Marge, Julia taught me lots of stuff that could help us.
S28E02_1114#For example, I realize that when you see me
S28E02_1115#doing something stupid 
S28E02_1117#and you don't say anything about it, you know,
S28E02_1120#and you're just being nice.
S28E02_1123#- That's true. - And when something's bothering you,
S28E02_1126#sometimes I should just say,
S28E02_1129#"I understand," instead of trying to fix it.
S28E02_1132#Because all you really need is someone to know what you're feeling.
S28E02_1136#That is really, really lovely.
S28E02_1142#I have to confess, I did see him naked on the roof.
S28E02_1145#I did, too, and I was at 10,000 feet.
S28E02_1148#Now for the final fantasy.
S28E02_1154#Oh, my love, my love,
S28E02_1157#losing you so young, so beautiful.
S28E02_1160#Still no jokes.
S28E02_1165#I love you, and how.
S28E02_1169#You're too good for heaven, man.
S28E02_1172#Excellent.
S28E02_1181#Welcome, Monty.
S28E02_1183#I'd like to take a selfie with you.
S28E02_1188#All right, but just one.
S28E02_1190#Hmm, it's not plugged in.
S28E03_61#The only reason Boston wins is because they cheat!
S28E03_64#Listening in on our teams' headsets, fattening our cheerleaders.
S28E03_66#You know, for three games last year,
S28E03_68#Boston used a volleyball painted brown.
S28E03_71#That was never proven, you Springfield screw-job.
S28E03_74#Boston fans.
S28E03_76#In town for the Dennis Lehane book tour.
S28E03_79#Go kiss a Kennedy, you rule-breaking cranberry squeezers!
S28E03_81#We don't cheat.
S28E03_84#We won 12 division titles in ten years, fair and square.
S28E03_88#You dorks are just jealous of all our championship rings.
S28E03_93#You're the one who's jealous.
S28E03_95#I only wish I could be as jealous as you.
S28E03_97#Geez, Jay, this place has got more knobs than a hardware store.
S28E03_100#I hate this town.
S28E03_102#So don't I. Friggin' doorknobs.
S28E03_105#Automatic.
S28E03_110#It's fourth and long, the Americans' last chance for a miracle.
S28E03_113#Come on, Springfield, put it away!
S28E03_115#We're gonna win one. We're finally gonna win one!
S28E03_117#The QB handsomely takes the snap,
S28E03_119#sexily steps back to pass,
S28E03_121#and with God-given good looks, fires it downfield!
S28E03_124#But there's no one there to receive it!
S28E03_125#Nice pass.
S28E03_127#What a first-ballot hall-of-fame loser.
S28E03_131#But the ball is caught by the Americans' mascot, Flappy the Flag!
S28E03_134#Flappy running unopposed into the end zone
S28E03_136#for a surely illegal touchdown.
S28E03_138#Throwing to the mascot?
S28E03_141#After further review, Flappy the Flag is listed
S28E03_145#on the Americans' 53-man roster and reported eligible.
S28E03_148#The result of the play is a touchdown.
S28E03_151#Once again, the Americans found a way to win.
S28E03_153#Oh, that'll put a smile on Coach Bonderchuck's face.
S28E03_159#Oh, not again!
S28E03_161#They cheated! You cheated!
S28E03_163#Did not. You got to cover the mascot.
S28E03_165#Use your noggin. Play smart.
S28E03_167#Flappy's on the roster.
S28E03_169#On the roster!
S28E03_172#- On the roster! - On the roster!
S28E03_175#On the roster, my butt.
S28E03_177#Once again, those Boston cheaters 
S28E03_179#think the rules don't apply to them.
S28E03_181#And they're so smug about winning.
S28E03_183#If I ever won anything, I wouldn't be smug about it.
S28E03_186#I'd be class all the way,
S28E03_188#like Mark Harmon... pure American elegance.
S28E03_192#I tell ya, the next Boston fan I see, I'm just gonna lose it.
S28E03_195#Lose it so hard.
S28E03_197#And... What the...
S28E03_199#What is... How could...
S28E03_201#That hat! Your head!
S28E03_203#That team.
S28E03_205#My son!
S28E03_207#Hey, Dad, caught the game last night.
S28E03_209#Tough loss for your guys.
S28E03_210#Guess we just wanted it more.
S28E03_212#Oh, am I in the right house?
S28E03_214#Because no one in my house
S28E03_217#would ever be caught dead wearing Boston Americans gear.
S28E03_220#Dead!
S28E03_222#I feel ya, Homer.
S28E03_223#Sucks to be a loser.
S28E03_226#Unlike the six-time Mega-Bowl champion Boston Americans.
S28E03_230#Ring, ring, ring.
S28E03_232#Give me that hat.
S28E03_240#Ol¨¦!
S28E03_244#Your father never could resist an "Ol¨¦."
S28E03_246#Eh, he'll run out of steam soon.
S28E03_255#Get in.
S28E03_259#Look around, son.
S28E03_261#This is your hometown.
S28E03_263#And the Springfield Atoms are your hometown team...
S28E03_266#Since 2003, when we stole them
S28E03_268#in the middle of the night from Portland.
S28E03_270#What kind of life can you have here 
S28E03_272#as a Boston fan?
S28E03_273#See?
S28E03_276#Why are you wearing that Boston hat?
S28E03_277#This is Atoms country, bro!
S28E03_279#I would pluck out my own eyes 
S28E03_281#if I did not have a call-back
S28E03_284#for a Web-only Olive Garden commercial.
S28E03_290#They're just trying to hat shame me.
S28E03_291#Face it, Dad, 
S28E03_293#Boston is the Bart Simpson of cities.
S28E03_295#All those awesome Southies in The Departed,
S28E03_297#those are my people.
S28E03_299#People? The dog and the baby are your people.
S28E03_302#It all goes back to the Boston Tea Party,
S28E03_305#a prank so kick-ass it started a country.
S28E03_309#Come on, pal, what do you say?
S28E03_311#Just lose the hat, for your old man.
S28E03_316#Nope, I think I'll stick with the bad boys.
S28E03_321#Get it off before God sees.
S28E03_331#And the people from Boston are so obnoxious.
S28E03_335#They think their stupid city has the best everything:
S28E03_338#bands, comedians, chowder,
S28E03_340#their so-called cream pies, which are actually cakes.
S28E03_342#- And there's... - Why don't you let me
S28E03_344#take your mind off your problems? 
S28E03_347#And what's with Aerosmith?
S28E03_349#That's not how you spell "Arrow."
S28E03_350#The...
S28E03_364#Do your job, Homer.
S28E03_368#Bart, you're my son.
S28E03_370#There's no neck tattoo so crass,
S28E03_372#no gender reassignment too ambiguous
S28E03_374#that I would not love you.
S28E03_376#Which is why I must show you the error of your ways,
S28E03_380#even if it means dragging this family all the way to hell.
S28E03_384#A vacation to Boston?
S28E03_388#No, not a vay-cation, a hate-cation!
S28E03_391#Where you experience the worst a place has to offer, 
S28E03_394#and then say, "Told ya!"
S28E03_396#Hate-watching, hate-voting
S28E03_397#and now a hate-cation?
S28E03_399#Why can't everyone just enjoy things they like?
S28E03_402#Because things you like
S28E03_404#don't fill you with delicious, delicious rage.
S28E03_406#Hmm, I'm gonna love this trip.
S28E03_408#I'm gonna love it right in your face.
S28E03_410#That's it, build it up in your head.
S28E03_413#High hopes just make the hate-cation stronger.
S28E03_416#You're crazy. Boston can't be that bad.
S28E03_424#I've never loved hating anything so much!
S28E03_427#Move your garbage car!
S28E03_429#I got to get to the packy before the B's drop puck!
S28E03_433#Told ya!
S28E03_439#See, boy?
S28E03_441#Notice how Bostonians aren't exactly ugly,
S28E03_443#but they're not sexy either.
S28E03_446#Homer, your negative attitude is ruining this hate-cation.
S28E03_449#So, what to hate first? The Freedom Trail?
S28E03_452#The touch tank at the New England Aquarium?
S28E03_454#Ooh, that could blow.
S28E03_455#I want to go to Southie.
S28E03_458#That part of town has the towniest townies of any town.
S28E03_461#You think your Bostonians are so great?
S28E03_463#Watch as your beloved hooligans
S28E03_466#tear your innocent father limb from limb
S28E03_468#with just the slightest provocation.
S28E03_471#Listen up,
S28E03_473#you clam-gargling tea-tossers!
S28E03_476#Fenway is a terrible ballpark!
S28E03_478#Dad, don't!
S28E03_480#Out of my way, ladies. You're blocking my shot.
S28E03_482#The seats at Fenway Park are too narrow,
S28E03_485#and many of them face center field!
S28E03_489#It's not charming, it's a teardown!
S28E03_492#The bobbleheads!
S28E03_493#They're tippin'!
S28E03_495#Kid, mind the cart!
S28E03_496#- The what? - The cart!
S28E03_497#The cot?
S28E03_499#Cot!
S28E03_504#No, don't struggle!
S28E03_506#It only makes them bobble harder.
S28E03_508#They keep coming. Bobblehead Steven Wright,
S28E03_511#bobblehead Aimee Mann, bobblehead Bell Biv Devoe!
S28E03_514#The vibrations are killing him!
S28E03_516#Don't worry, sweetheart, I'm a doctor.
S28E03_519#I'm also a doctor, kid.
S28E03_523#Mm, so many doctors.
S28E03_525#He's got a Pedro lodged in his airway.
S28E03_528#He'll be fine, ma'am.
S28E03_530#And because of our state's super-socialized health care,
S28E03_533#no matter how much your husband abuses his body,
S28E03_536#someone else will pay for it.
S28E03_538#What a relief for women with hot-tempered,
S28E03_541#accident-prone husbands.
S28E03_543#Oh, yeah, we got a whole surgical center
S28E03_545#for injuries from falling off icy roofs and gutters.
S28E03_553#While the doctors pull tiny Bruins helmets out of your skin,
S28E03_556#Lisa and I are going to explore The Hub on our own.
S28E03_559#Remember, this is a hate-cation.
S28E03_560#You better go someplace bad.
S28E03_562#Isn't Mayor Quimby from somewhere around here?
S28E03_572#People are so fit here.
S28E03_574#Everyone looks like they're in a financial services ad.
S28E03_578#Free sunscreen? So progressive.
S28E03_581#Do you vaccinate your children?
S28E03_582#Of course.
S28E03_584#But not stupid progressive.
S28E03_587#What's that buzzing noise?
S28E03_591#It's-it's nerds!
S28E03_593#They've got every recognized species of nerd!
S28E03_596#A jester-hatted ferret preener!

S28E03_601#Oculus rifters!
S28E03_603#Yo-yo guys. Yo-yo girls!
S28E03_605#A chain mail ping pong player.
S28E03_609#So much education.
S28E03_612#If they did a Real Housewives here, it would be a total snooze.
S28E03_616#Ah, it's like heaven for people who don't believe in heaven.
S28E03_619#What the crap is this BS?
S28E03_621#What? I thought you'd want to try candlepin bowling.
S28E03_626#Hey, McCarthy, nice half-Worcester.
S28E03_629#Get bent, McDonald.
S28E03_631#A lot of wood to work with out there.
S28E03_632#Boston.
S28E03_634#They even found a way to mess up bowling.
S28E03_636#Just try it.
S28E03_639#Eh, all right.
S28E03_646#None of the usual pain in my knees, back,
S28E03_648#wrist, shoulder, neck, and chest.
S28E03_657#One pin standing.
S28E03_658#Story of my life.
S28E03_660#Whoa there, pal.
S28E03_662#Don't forget your third ball.
S28E03_663#Hold on, wait.
S28E03_664#Wait. Hold on.
S28E03_665#Wait.
S28E03_668#What?
S28E03_670#This is candlepin bowling.
S28E03_671#You get three.
S28E03_682#Three balls.
S28E03_684#I see it all so clearly now.
S28E03_687#What, Dad? What is it?
S28E03_689#This regional bowling with its one extra roll
S28E03_693#has knocked my misguided hate into the gutter.
S28E03_697#I like Boston!
S28E03_699#Dad, you and me are real father-son Southies, now.
S28E03_702#Just like Ben and Casey Affleck.
S28E03_705#Son, show me everything this town has to offer.
S28E03_734#You know, for a cake,
S28E03_736#this Boston cream pie isn't so bad.
S28E03_739#Look at them. So innocent.
S28E03_741#Not Bart, but go on.
S28E03_743#Homer,
S28E03_745#I never dared dream about living somewhere that values education, 
S28E03_748#with great health care,
S28E03_750#and everyone's outdoorsy but still pallid.
S28E03_752#If it weren't crazy,
S28E03_754#I'd say we should be raising our kids here.
S28E03_756#But no. No, no. That's crazy!
S28E03_758#Is it?
S28E03_761#But I never thought you, of all people...
S28E03_764#Honey, this could be the chance we never thought we'd get.
S28E03_767#The chance to knock down all of life's pins.
S28E03_770#Are you saying what I think you're saying?
S28E03_774#I am. Fate is offering us a third ball.
S28E03_778#Do you mean it? Are we going to move to Boston?
S28E03_781#I knew I didn't pay this month's mortgage for a reason.
S28E03_799#We did it! We really did it! We made a life change.
S28E03_802#I love these colonial quilts on the wall.
S28E03_805#Now, I can take a nap standing up.
S28E03_813#Check it out, kid.
S28E03_815#This movie's my life now.
S28E03_819#You want to rob the Harvard Coop?
S28E03_821#Why don't we just break into Fort Knox?
S28E03_823#These snobs think Mass Ave. belongs to them.
S28E03_826#It's our Ave.
S28E03_834#I got to get one of those "X" necklaces to kiss.
S28E03_838#This is all happening so fast.
S28E03_840#Can we really afford to live in a city
S28E03_842#with a symphony and a Pops?
S28E03_844#Don't worry, baby.
S28E03_846#I have a line on a sweet safety inspector gig.
S28E03_849#Very sweet.
S28E03_862#Can I get a test on batch six?
S28E03_865#I'm finally living my dream
S28E03_867#of never not being around batches of candy.

S28E03_872#if I screw up, no one gets hurt.
S28E03_878#Are you sure we have to go to school here?
S28E03_880#I sort of thought I'd go straight to running numbers

S28E03_891#Here's my classroom.
S28E03_894#The teacher is Doris Kearns Goodwin.
S28E03_898#Today, we explore Lincoln's 1861 suspension of habeas corpus,

S28E03_917#How do you like them marbles?
S28E03_919#Bart, we have a place for kids like you.
S28E03_921#Bring it on.
S28E03_927#Kids singing?
S28E03_934#What the hell?
S28E03_936#Like you, these kids are gifted with exceptional energy,
S28E03_939#which they've channeled into a cappella.
S28E03_942#*I'm shipping up to Boston*

S28E03_949#I've never felt more like I fit in.
S28E03_951#People think Boston's all Southies and hooligans.
S28E03_954#But it's really teachers, Ph.D. Students,
S28E03_957#doctors, innovators, philanthropists.

S28E03_961#And every day is a new test.
S28E03_968#Theater?
S28E03_970#Colleges?
S28E03_973#Culture?
S28E03_977#Oh, Pauly,
S28E03_979#if you could have known that Boston was gonna turn out so wussy,
S28E03_982#you never would have warned anybody.
S28E03_985#Listen, my brother, and you shall see,
S28E03_988#this is a town not for you, but for me.
S28E03_994#Hey, but what about Grampa?
S28E03_996#He lives a thousand miles away.
S28E03_997#Great point.
S28E03_998#Nobody tell him where we went.
S28E03_1000#Bart, you haven't touched your clambake.
S28E03_1002#What's wrong?
S28E03_1004#This place is all P.C. Brainiacs and Subaru owners
S28E03_1006#wearing fleece vests.
S28E03_1008#It's nothing at all like The Departed.
S28E03_1010#Oh, honey, I know it's a big change.
S28E03_1013#But someday you'll understand that providing our family
S28E03_1016#with a better life...
S28E03_1018#Something I've never been able to do.
S28E03_1020#...is the most important thing in the world.
S28E03_1023#We've been given a third ball.
S28E03_1025#Let's not throw it away.
S28E03_1029#Same to you.
S28E03_1031#No one likes feeling out of place.
S28E03_1033#That's how I felt back in Springfield.
S28E03_1035#But I sucked it up for eight years.

S28E03_1051#Yes! Finally.
S28E03_1053#A Southie crew pulling a job.
S28E03_1055#I finally took that spin class with Miranda.
S28E03_1058#I was sweatin' so friggin' hard.

S28E03_1066#these solar laptops for Rwandans

S28E03_1071#It's time for me to ship out of Boston.
S28E03_1075#What a gorgeous day.
S28E03_1077#I hope it never ends.
S28E03_1079#So don't I.
S28E03_1081#You know, guys, I've picked out the perfect Boston activity
S28E03_1084#to help celebrate our move.
S28E03_1086#Ooh, a parade.
S28E03_1088#Not just any parade.
S28E03_1090#The Boston Americans?
S28E03_1094#Bonk! Bonk! Bonk!
S28E03_1097#It's a state holiday 
S28E03_1099#because the league overturned the coach's suspension
S28E03_1101#for using magnets to affect the coin toss.
S28E03_1103#Pretty cool way to celebrate our new hometown.
S28E03_1105#Right, Dad?
S28E03_1108#As a Bostonian, I definitely support my team.
S28E03_1114#Hey, Bonk! Can we get a picture?
S28E03_1116#Hell to the derrr, little bro!
S28E03_1120#Come on, Homer, put on the hat.
S28E03_1123#I can support my hometown team without putting on a hat.
S28E03_1126#Hats go on your head!
S28E03_1128#If you're gonna live in Boston, you got to wear the hat.
S28E03_1133#Okay.
S28E03_1140#You did this on purpose.
S28E03_1142#My future is at stake.
S28E03_1144#So don't is mine.
S28E03_1146#Just... a... hat.
S28E03_1149#You can do it, Homie.
S28E03_1150#Think of the candlepins.
S28E03_1152#This is our extra ball!
S28E03_1156#A... better... life.
S28E03_1167#Stupid cheaters!
S28E03_1168#You cheat,
S28E03_1170#you flip out when people say you cheat,
S28E03_1172#and everybody knows
S28E03_1174#you're nothing but a big bunch of cheaters!
S28E03_1179#You made us leave that lovely city
S28E03_1181#rather than just put on a stupid hat.
S28E03_1183#It wasn't even fitted.
S28E03_1185#I just couldn't wear the hat.
S28E03_1187#Well, I'm still mad at you.
S28E03_1189#I never even got to experience one of those Boston winters
S28E03_1192#everyone raves about.
S28E03_1194#Come on, baby, we could never escape our problems
S28E03_1196#by moving somewhere else.
S28E03_1198#Our problems are who we are, not where we are.
S28E03_1201#Well... maybe.
S28E03_1203#The traffic was pretty annoying.
S28E03_1205#Not to mention the unspoken racism.
S28E03_1208#It wasn't that unspoken.
S28E03_1211#At least someone in this family
S28E03_1213#is happy about where they came from.
S28E03_1216#Oh, don't worry, Lisa.
S28E03_1218#You'll get back to Boston someday.
S28E03_1220#What are you talking about?
S28E03_1221#I never left.
S28E03_1223#I'm in Boston now.
S28E03_1227#Welcome home, Lisa.
S28E03_1229#Class is about to start.
S28E01_120#And that's where Lard Lad used to be!
S28E01_123#Oh, looks like we better file a report
S28E01_125#with the Bureau of Missing Statues.
S28E01_127#Yeah. Be like that time that Rodin statue got stolen.
S28E01_130#What was the name of that statue again?
S28E01_132#Ah, let me think.
S28E01_133#Thinkin'.
S28E01_135#Yeah, still thinkin'.
S28E01_137#Still thinkin'.
S28E01_140#Uh, either we can fan out and search,
S28E01_142#or bunch up and riot.
S28E01_144#Oh, balderdash and poppycock. I say we do not riot.
S28E01_146#Riot!
S28E01_148#Don't!
S28E01_149#Riot!
S28E01_150#Don't!
S28E01_152#Riot!
S28E01_165#And thanks to the equal number of nonrioters,
S28E01_168#the total cost of the damage is zero dollars.
S28E01_171#Homer, were you in that riot?
S28E01_172#Marge, please.
S28E01_174#I'm a leader in this community.
S28E01_176#In response to the outcry,
S28E01_178#Lard Lad's parent company,
S28E01_180#Tianjin Mining and Smelting and Donuts,
S28E01_181#has issued the following statement:
S28E01_184#"We are rebranding Lard Lad with an updated statue."
S28E01_187#Rebranding.
S28E01_189#That just means admitting failure, Dad.
S28E01_191#Admitting failure.
S28E01_193#People of Springfield,
S28E01_195#please welcome Mr....
S28E01_197#I know I'm gonna mangle this... Lee Fong.
S28E01_200#Uh, actually, it's pronounced Robert Chan.
S28E01_204#And now, please welcome the model for the original Lard Lad,
S28E01_207#Mr. Laird Lad.
S28E01_209#A lot of crazy names today.
S28E01_213#Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Lard Lad's bold,
S28E01_216#focus-grouped, new look!
S28E01_222#That doesn't say donuts!
S28E01_224#that says management overthink!
S28E01_226#The Thinker!
S28E01_228#That statue's called The Thinker.
S28E01_230#What? What are we on now?
S28E01_231#What?
S28E01_232#People, let's give the new statue a chance.
S28E01_235#When the Eiffel Tower was first built,
S28E01_237#many said it was a steel monstrosity.
S28E01_240#It still is.
S28E01_242#Fine, but maybe this will grow on you.
S28E01_245#- Aw, this thing sucks. - I don't think so.
S28E01_248#Well, at-at-at a certain angle...
S28E01_249#it's beautiful.
S28E01_250#- We love it. - That's beautiful.
S28E01_257#You fools!
S28E01_259#You've erected a massive concave reflective surface.
S28E01_262#It will focus the sun's beam in a deadly ray.
S28E01_283#- Yeah! - Yeah!
S28E01_299#First off, I'd like to thank the good people
S28E01_302#at Tianjin Smelting and Mining and Donuts and Tarps
S28E01_306#for neutralizing our wonderful, deadly, new Lard Lad.
S28E01_309#Yeah, that's great.
S28E01_311#They'll grow back.
S28E01_314#The time for mourning and blaming our mayors has passed.
S28E01_317#We will rebuild.
S28E01_319#We will rebuild.
S28E01_321#We will rebuild.
S28E01_323#We will rebuild!
S28E01_326#We will rebuild!
S28E01_336#We will rebuild.
S28E01_338#We will rebuild.
S28E01_340#I guess there's only one man we can turn to.
S28E01_342#Supergirl?!
S28E01_348#So... you'd like me to save the town.
S28E01_351#Well, you've got gumption, I'll give you that.
S28E01_353#And such an adorable baby,
S28E01_355#it really restores my... my faith in... in the, uh...
S28E01_358#Smithers, where is the damn trapdoor button?
S28E01_361#Mr. Burns, you already trap-doored us
S28E01_364#from your upstairs office.
S28E01_365#Yes.
S28E01_366#And how was your fall?
S28E01_368#Painful? Unexpected?
S28E01_370#- Oh, yeah. - Worst I've ever had.
S28E01_371#- Oh! Really... - Really...
S28E01_372#- Pulled something. - Totally painful.
S28E01_374#Did not see it coming.
S28E01_376#Excellent.
S28E01_380#So... remind me what I was saying no to.
S28E01_383#Funding repairs to the town.
S28E01_385#But if you could do even one little project.
S28E01_388#Reducking the duck pond
S28E01_390#or fixing up the Springfield Bowl.
S28E01_392#The Springfield Bowl.
S28E01_399#Very well.
S28E01_401#I will rebuild this town on one condition.
S28E01_403#Forget it.
S28E01_405#Our desperate plea is nonnegotiable.
S28E01_407#I want to put on a variety show at the Bowl.
S28E01_410#A celebration of everything wonderful about...
S28E01_412#what's the name of this town again?
S28E01_413#Springfield, sir.
S28E01_415#Yes, I will destroy Springfield.
S28E01_417#Celebrate, sir.
S28E01_419#Fine, we will try your way first.
S28E01_423#Springfield has risen from the ashes like a phoenix.
S28E01_425#That's phoenix, the mythical bird,
S28E01_428#not Phoenix, the cultureless, Mars-scape of the Southwest.
S28E01_431#Our unlikely angel,
S28E01_433#the devil himself, C. Montgomery Burns.
S28E01_435#Thank you, Kent.
S28E01_439#And don't forget the open auditions
S28E01_441#for my Springfield Follies.
S28E01_443#This year women may audition, too,
S28E01_444#with permission of husband,
S28E01_446#father and pastor in writing.
S28E01_449#Next.
S28E01_460#*Un bel di, vedremo*
S28E01_467#*Levarsi un fil di fumo*
S28E01_471#Puccini's a little well-trod, don't you think?
S28E01_475#This isn't right.
S28E01_477#This isn't how it was at all.
S28E01_479#I remember that night so vividly.
S28E01_485#Monty, time to go on stage.
S28E01_486#Yes, Mama.
S28E01_488#Your little butterscotch drop won't let you down.
S28E01_491#Aw, who's candy?
S28E01_492#You's candy.
S28E01_494#Oh, I'm gonna lick you, my sweet little lolly.
S28E01_496#Who likes Mommy's licks?
S28E01_498#Monty likes Mommy's licks.
S28E01_499#Lickity, lickity, lick.
S28E01_506#But the butterscotch soon turned to bitter squelch.
S28E01_509#I want everything just as it was back then.
S28E01_511#The stage filled with children
S28E01_512#like those from 1913.
S28E01_514#High-spirited, snaggletoothed,
S28E01_516#and willing to work 18 hours a day.
S28E01_517#Attention.
S28E01_520#An old man is prowling the school, looking for young children.
S28E01_522#Please, perform for him.
S28E01_525#Watch me make this nerd disappear.
S28E01_529#Also...
S28E01_531#Excellent villain.
S28E01_532#And my cast is complete.
S28E01_534#I'll just save the list and...
S28E01_539#Samson himself could not pry open these jaws.
S28E01_541#Can I help you, sir?
S28E01_543#Oh, women aren't meant for clasp opening.
S28E01_548#Young lady, if there's one thing I know about show business,
S28E01_551#it's that there are a lot of clipboards.
S28E01_553#How would you like to be my assistant director?
S28E01_557#And I'll be perfectly positioned
S28E01_559#to find out exactly what Mr. Burns is really up to.
S28E01_561#I'm in.
S28E01_563#And if you need another act,
S28E01_565#I also play this.
S28E01_566#There's no room in my show
S28E01_568#for Adolphe Sax's vile-sounding o-phone.
S28E01_571#Do you ever say anything in a simple way?
S28E01_572#Shut up.
S28E01_574#Well, that was clear.
S28E01_577#Hey, Homer, are you sure we haven't let the plant
S28E01_579#slip with Mr. Burns gone?
S28E01_581#Smitty, as a wise, old man once said,
S28E01_583#"Out with the old...
S28E01_585#and in with the brew."
S28E01_618#That's enough.
S28E01_620#But I haven't started my act.
S28E01_622#Muntz, what have you got?
S28E01_623#A rabbit in a bag.
S28E01_625#Ooh, a promising magic trick.
S28E01_627#No, it's my lunch.
S28E01_629#Bah! You're all incompetent.
S28E01_631#I won't go through this a second time.
S28E01_632#Second time?
S28E01_634#Is there something you're not telling us?
S28E01_635#A vast amount.
S28E01_637#And what part of "What I've never told you"
S28E01_639#Don't you understand?
S28E01_649#Mother, what is that sound they're making?
S28E01_650#Well, it's called laughter.
S28E01_652#You're a laughingstock, Charles.
S28E01_654#Oh, oh, it's awful.
S28E01_657#This show isn't good enough.
S28E01_659#No show could be good enough.
S28E01_661#It's not?
S28E01_670#What are you doing?
S28E01_672#Getting ready for Monday.
S28E01_675#I'm gonna fill a Super Soaker full of lemonade,
S28E01_677#Carl's gonna fill one with iced tea,
S28E01_679#and we're gonna Arnold Palmer Lenny
S28E01_681#when he walks in.
S28E01_686#Arnold Palmer Lenny.
S28E01_688#You're going to Arnold Palmer Lenny.
S28E01_692#Yeah, you see, Arnold Palmer was a golfer
S28E01_695#and he made up this drink
S28E01_697#where it's not a full glass of lemonade
S28E01_700#or a full glass of iced tea.
S28E01_702#Instead...
S28E01_704#Homie, I'm worried about all this silliness at work.
S28E01_707#You're the safety inspector.
S28E01_709#I'm a safety inspector.
S28E01_711#Not the.
S28E01_712#I've never seen another.
S28E01_714#What... wait, one safety inspector?
S28E01_716#For the whole nuclear plant?
S28E01_718#That's insane.
S28E01_721#Put everything in the car and get out of town.
S28E01_723#I'll find you, if there are still roads!
S28E01_725#Sweetie, sweetie,
S28E01_727#all you've got to do is be responsible.
S28E01_729#Your friends consider you the leader
S28E01_731#because you're a little taller.
S28E01_736#With above-average height comes above-average responsibility.
S28E01_739#Marge, thank you for setting me straight.
S28E01_741#You're welcome.
S28E01_744#Okay, I want to open this show
S28E01_746#with someone being shot into a cannon.
S28E01_750#You're joking, right?
S28E01_753#Well, because, see, that's impossible.
S28E01_762#Everyone, little miss nitpick hates the show,
S28E01_764#so I'm shutting it down.
S28E01_768#This was an act.
S28E01_769#Now it's just bullying.
S28E01_779#Thanks a lot, Lisa.
S28E01_781#We were getting out of school for this.
S28E01_787#Well if isn't the little girl that made a billionaire cry.
S28E01_789#May I please speak with Mr. Burns?
S28E01_791#No, he's very busy.
S28E01_795#Won't you please come back and do the show?
S28E01_797#Shan't.
S28E01_803#Oh, that bell has quite the recoil.
S28E01_806#Oh, what is bothering him?
S28E01_808#And what were those weird lines around his eyes?
S28E01_810#I know.
S28E01_812#It's such a tragedy on that beautiful face.
S28E01_815#Come here.
S28E01_817#Well, there's only one explanation for those lines, Lisa.
S28E01_820#He's been watching something on the Mutoscope.
S28E01_825#So, if I play this,
S28E01_827#I'll know the answer.
S28E01_829#It, uh, costs a nickel.
S28E01_854#So this is what made Mr. Burns the monster he is.
S28E01_858#Within days
S28E01_860#half of America was cranking to my bottom.
S28E01_863#I think you're trying to make up for what happened to you then
S28E01_865#by putting on a perfect Bowl show now.
S28E01_868#Spare me your amateur psychology.
S28E01_870#"Ooh, I saw my father decapitated by a grain harvester
S28E01_873#"And now I can't enjoy wheat. Boohoo."
S28E01_877#Mr. Burns, I want you to listen to that crowd.
S28E01_885#Do you really want to let those happy, joyous people win?
S28E01_894#Smithers, locate my dickey.
S28E01_895#We've got a show to do.
S28E01_897#*I was gonna clean my room*
S28E01_899#*Until I got high*
S28E01_902#*I was gonna get up and find the broom*
S28E01_904#*But then...*
S28E01_906#Springfield Nuclear.
S28E01_908#Yes, yes, sir, I'll alert the workers...
S28E01_910#that the pizzas are here!
S28E01_914#Oh, yeah, here he comes.
S28E01_916#The life of this party!
S28E01_919#Who wants to get back to work?
S28E01_921#What?
S28E01_924#We are a public trust.
S28E01_926#We bring power to people's homes.
S28E01_930#Lightbulbs, toasters, and that's all I can think of.
S28E01_933#Now let's buckle down!
S28E01_937#Okay, Homer, just let us get our microwave popcorn
S28E01_939#out of the core.
S28E01_940#You're only supposed to do that
S28E01_942#when we're watching a movie in the core.
S28E01_970#Thank you, thank you.
S28E01_971#Well, that's the easiest time
S28E01_973#anyone's had parking at the Springfield Bowl.
S28E01_976#Don't you laugh at me!
S28E01_979#Now, enjoy the show.
S28E01_982#God always liked you best.
S28E01_984#No, God loves everyone equally.
S28E01_987#That's wonderful news.
S28E01_990#Enough of your tomfoolery, Todd.
S28E01_992#Let's sing.
S28E01_994#*Michael, row your boat ashore*
S28E01_998#*Hallelujah*
S28E01_1001#*Michael, row your boat ashore*
S28E01_1004#*Hallelu...*
S28E01_1008#Say, Sockie, who was that lady I saw you with last night?
S28E01_1011#That was no lady.
S28E01_1013#That was your mother.
S28E01_1015#Oh, she'll date anyone.
S28E01_1017#Why won't she give me a stable home?
S28E01_1033#Um, this is just a simple twins trick.
S28E01_1035#They pulled the other twin out of the tank
S28E01_1037#behind the curtain.
S28E01_1046#Wait, that wasn't part of the show.
S28E01_1049#No. No, it's not fair!
S28E01_1051#I was good!
S28E01_1052#Arnold.
S28E01_1053#Palmer!
S28E01_1057#Fantastic.
S28E01_1059#What a finale, eh, Mr. Burns?
S28E01_1061#Childhood trauma cured, huh, huh?
S28E01_1064#That wasn't the finale.
S28E01_1071#Maestro, "Golden Slippers," if you please.
S28E01_1073#Ooh, boy.
S28E01_1080#We can't let him make a fool of himself again.
S28E01_1083#No, no, Mr. Burns needs to do this.
S28E01_1089#*Oh, dem golden slippers*
S28E01_1091#*Oh, dem gold...*
S28E01_1094#The burn.
S28E01_1096#Mr. Burns can't take the impact of that many photons.
S28E01_1099#Those light-shining fools!
S28E01_1108#Oh, for a murder of crows
S28E01_1111#to pluck out mine eyes!
S28E01_1112#You.
S28E01_1113#This show was your fault.
S28E01_1115#Well, you'd better know this, mister.
S28E01_1117#This town has my back.
S28E01_1118#And... hey.
S28E01_1120#Where did they go?
S28E01_1122#How did 15,000 people leave so fast?
S28E01_1126#Want to see me do a cartwheel?
S28E01_1132#Always had trouble with those.
S28E01_1135#Oh, I can't stay mad at you.
S28E01_1137#At my age, I can't stay anything at anybody.
S28E01_1139#Oh, and you know what?
S28E01_1141#The laughter in my head is gone.
S28E01_1143#Go ahead, blow your German kazoo.
S28E01_1145#Yes, sir!
S28E01_1150#Smithers, tap my foot for me.
S28E01_1152#With impatience.
S28E01_1154#Now, lift my arm so I can check my watch.
S28E01_1156#Oh, you really should start doing
S28E01_1157#some of these things yourself.
S28E01_1163#Dad, why do Simpsons always fail?
S28E01_1166#Oh, sweetie pie,
S28E01_1168#it's a terrible curse that goes back centuries.
S28E01_1172#No, no!
S28E01_1173#Don't answer that.
S28E01_1175#We just need a place to stay for the night.
S28E01_1178#Oh, shouldn't we help them?
S28E01_1180#Hey, in Zero BC, you can't trust anybody.
S28E01_1183#Curse them, Mary!
S28E01_1185#You curse them, my water just broke!
S28E01_1186#Please?
S28E01_1193#You're telling me that really happened?
S28E01_1195#They looked just like us, didn't they?
S28E01_1209#Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's all, folks!
S28E02_126#That is my family...people who love me.
S28E02_129#Yes, you're right.
S28E02_131#I should consider encasing people in plastic.
S28E02_133#Then I could always see the look of fear in their faces.
S28E02_136#Yeah, we're finished here. Get out.
S28E02_138#May I remind you I'm paying you five dollars an hour?
S28E02_140#Oi! Why did I lock in at that rate?
S28E02_148#What?
S28E02_153#Hmm. No pulse. Oh, wait, that's me.
S28E02_158#Dead. So sad. He was a true friend.
S28E02_162#Excellent.
S28E02_167#I can't believe Dr. Nussbaum's dead.
S28E02_170#Um, we've had a lot of therapists.
S28E02_173#Which one was he again?
S28E02_175#He was the one who helped us communicate.
S28E02_178#- You never listen to a word I say! - I have to listen all day at work.
S28E02_181#- You're not listening now. - I'm listened out!
S28E02_182#- What? "Listened out." - Not listening...
S28E02_184#- What does that even mean? - Not listening,  
S28E02_186#Let's hear what the children have to say.
S28E02_188#- I'm gonna wet the bed to get their attention. - Not listening...
S28E02_190#You're the one sleeping in it.
S28E02_192#I didn't say I'd wet my bed.
S28E02_194#Please, Marge! Do we have to burden
S28E02_196#Dr. Nussbaum with our problems?
S28E02_198#- Maggie talk! - The man has problems of his own!
S28E02_200#Maggie talk!
S28E02_204#No one listen? Maggie never talk again.
S28E02_208#- That's not what happened. - That's exactly what happened.
S28E02_210#I believe I remember what happened, Marge. - How could you remember?
S28E02_213#You were looking at your phone half the time.
S28E02_215#When you have four bar Wi-Fi, you use it!
S28E02_218#Oh, look. It's the ugly people from the cube.
S28E02_220#Uh, if we can begin.
S28E02_222#Oh, of course.
S28E02_224#Oh, this man meant a great deal to me.
S28E02_226#And helping out with the cost of this service 
S28E02_227#was the least I could do.
S28E02_228#Very sweet.
S28E02_229#Smithers?
S28E02_234#For shame!
S28E02_243#Stoned at a funeral.
S28E02_245#Ooh, wow! Where's the funeral?
S28E02_249#Oh! Just what I wanted.
S28E02_251#Just get me home quickly.
S28E02_259#And this year's Nobel Prize for Physics goes to...
S28E02_262#Professor John Frink.
S28E02_271#Ah, thank you, Queen Sonya, and all the people at HBO...
S28E02_274#the, uh, Higgs Boson Observatory.
S28E02_276#You'll see there.
S28E02_278#Oi! Oiven!
S28E02_280#I-I didn't mean to hit him, sir.
S28E02_282#Well, how could a man in his right mind
S28E02_284#miss a car heading right towards him?
S28E02_286#Idiot!
S28E02_288#I think it's this headpiece he's wearing, sir.
S28E02_291#If I may ask, what makes this device so enchanting
S28E02_294#that you ignore the real world?
S28E02_296#Is there a milkmaid skipping rope?
S28E02_302#Oi! Gloivick!
S28E02_304#The Oculus Frink... or Froculus...
S28E02_308#provides you with a complete virtual reality experience.
S28E02_311#Letting you live in a world of your dreams.
S28E02_319#To adjust the focus, turn the dial on the side.
S28E02_325#Now for the after-party!
S28E02_335#I must have it!
S28E02_337#Oh, uh, can you drop me off first?
S28E02_354#Not bad. Next?
S28E02_356#This is still a new technology, sir.
S28E02_358#At the moment, it's really just lots of pornography,
S28E02_361#a roller coaster, pornography, pornography,
S28E02_363#Burger King ad, pornography,
S28E02_364#and... and this one.
S28E02_376#Dragon porn.
S28E02_381#Oh, flame on, baby.
S28E02_382#Flame on!
S28E02_383#Hot! Hot!
S28E02_385#Don't tell my wife, okay?
S28E02_386#Oh, sorry, sir.
S28E02_388#This one is also pornography.
S28E02_389#Oh, so boring.
S28E02_392#Trim those nails, Smithers.
S28E02_394#Uh, sir, if I might suggest,
S28E02_396#the last thing your therapist said was,
S28E02_398#"You need a family."
S28E02_400#I don't need anyone.
S28E02_402#We could program a virtual family for you, sir.
S28E02_406#A virtual family. Yes.
S28E02_407#Meanwhile, let me see the one again
S28E02_409#where I shoot the beloved lion in Africa.
S28E02_411#That was reality, sir.
S28E02_413#I've lived quite the life.
S28E02_415#Quite the life.
S28E02_420#We only need three children, thanks.
S28E02_422#Oh, what kind of coal mine you runnin'?
S28E02_426#You, wife, look at me lovingly,
S28E02_429#as if I'm your husband.
S28E02_431#Can you ask for a look of indifference?
S28E02_433#I think she can do that.
S28E02_435#Luann, pretend it's my birthday.
S28E02_437#Next.
S28E02_439#You promised me a job, Dad!
S28E02_441#I was gonna buy a fat Barbie.
S28E02_443#It's Curvy Barbie.
S28E02_445#And that would mean you have to buy all new clothes.
S28E02_449#This thing says all families in the plant
S28E02_451#are required to try out.
S28E02_452#So far, so good.
S28E02_454#Two-and-a-half children, wife with current hairstyle.
S28E02_456#You're all hired.
S28E02_458#Except you, fatso. We don't need a father.
S28E02_460#I'll be the rooster in this henhouse.
S28E02_462#That is so disappointing.
S28E02_464#I've always wanted to work for Mr. Burns.
S28E02_470#Okay, family scene.
S28E02_472#And... action.
S28E02_486#This isn't a word I use lightly, but... excellent.
S28E02_489#Oh, Smithers, one favor:
S28E02_491#make the children look like they're mine.
S28E02_495#No, no, no! It's too beautiful.
S28E02_498#Like a Supreme Court full of Scalias.
S28E02_499#Switch to something else.
S28E02_507#That's good.
S28E02_508#What's the matter, Homer?
S28E02_510#Last night, Marge and the kids
S28E02_512#didn't get home till 11:00 at night.
S28E02_514#When I came back from Moe's at 11:05,
S28E02_516#they were still taking off their coats!
S28E02_519#I hear old man Burns is just living in a fantasy world now.
S28E02_521#En garde!
S28E02_523#Must be nice.
S28E02_525#Hey, there he is. Wonder what he's watching now.
S28E02_527#Home movies.
S28E02_531#*Happy birthday, dear Burnsie*
S28E02_536#*Happy birthday to you*
S28E02_540#*And maybe more*
S28E02_542#Thank you, thank you.
S28E02_544#Now, your mother's going to take me upstairs
S28E02_546#to give me... her present.
S28E02_553#Oh, Smithers, could you remove the ankle bar?
S28E02_556#More. More. More.
S28E02_562#That was wonderful.
S28E02_564#I'm picking up your ten-year options.
S28E02_566#Ten years?!
S28E02_568#Oh, now, now, no discussion.
S28E02_570#We're a family now.
S28E02_573#What is that? A river otter?
S28E02_580#We're not coming home, Homie.
S28E02_582#What? What do I do without you here?
S28E02_585#You can do what you did with me there: 
S28E02_587#go to Moe's.
S28E02_588#Aw, it's not the same
S28E02_590#if I'm not trying to avoid some unpleasant chore.
S28E02_593#Oh. You could clean out the attic.
S28E02_594#Going to Moe's!
S28E02_597#Eh, no one to go home to, huh?
S28E02_599#Yeah, take it from me, that's rough.
S28E02_600#Yeah.
S28E02_602#Heading back to an empty house.
S28E02_604#No one there to tell you what to do,
S28E02_605#no kids fighting all the time.
S28E02_607#Wait a minute.
S28E02_609#I can eat dinner in any room of the house!
S28E02_611#And not the scary ones like the basement and Bart's bedroom.
S28E02_614#And I can drink at home!
S28E02_616#Whoa, whoa! You're twisting my words there.
S28E02_618#That would be cheaper! And I wouldn't have to drive!
S28E02_620#And you are kind of mean.
S28E02_622#No one calls me mean.
S28E02_626#Moe, you're proving my point.
S28E02_628#Here we are talking, and you pull a shotgun on me.
S28E02_630#But there's never any bullets in this. Watch.
S28E02_634#Ha! Good gag, huh?
S28E02_694#Mmm, does that turn you on?
S28E02_696#Oh, yes. That's hot.
S28E02_700#The perfect temperature.
S28E02_706#Ah, Snoopy knew what he was doing, all right.
S28E02_708#How you doing?
S28E02_711#Don't worry, I've seen you naked plenty of times.
S28E02_714#I live in the house behind yours.
S28E02_716#I don't think my wife would like this.
S28E02_718#Hey, I got a boyfriend, 
S28E02_720#and you're not my type.
S28E02_721#Could you both keep it down?
S28E02_722#I'm trying to count pennies.
S28E02_725#Stupid Flanders.
S28E02_727#Oh! You made me lose count.
S28E02_731#Homer, it looks like you're out of beer, pal.
S28E02_736#Wow, can a man just be friends with a woman?
S28E02_738#Here are some pretzels.
S28E02_740#Yes, he can!
S28E02_746#Aw, don't worry. I'll fix that.
S28E02_749#Have one. I'm celebrating.
S28E02_751#My boyfriend proposed.
S28E02_754#Wow! You'll get to enjoy the most magical part of married life: 
S28E02_757#the beginning.
S28E02_761#So, uh, where's the lucky guy?
S28E02_763#Gone for the weekend.
S28E02_764#He's an airline pilot.
S28E02_766#Maybe he and I can go out for beers - before a flight. 
S28E02_769#Where's your wife?
S28E02_771#Uh, she's staying at this billionaire's house,
S28E02_774#working as a virtual reality actress.
S28E02_775#You know, the usual.
S28E02_777#Oh, Homer?
S28E02_779#Something's going on with Homer.
S28E02_781#My spousal sense is tingling.
S28E02_783#Mom, you blew the take!
S28E02_785#Okay, that's it. I'll direct.
S28E02_787#And I'll show you how a pro does it.
S28E02_789#You, daughter character, say you love me.
S28E02_790#I love you.
S28E02_791#Like you mean it.
S28E02_793#I really love you.
S28E02_794#Once more, with feeling.
S28E02_798#I... really... love... you.
S28E02_803#This girl has no chops whatsoever.
S28E02_805#The existence of my chops
S28E02_807#is not for the likes of you to ascertain, my good sir.
S28E02_811#Would you like some eggs with that ham?
S28E02_819#Looks like the old make-out king's got a new queen, huh?
S28E02_822#Guys, we're just friends.
S28E02_824#It's purely catatonic.
S28E02_825#"Platonic."
S28E02_827#That means she's into me, but I'm keeping it cool.
S28E02_830#I like you, but that's not what it means.
S28E02_833#Sure, right.
S28E02_836#Here you go, the antipasto, to share.
S28E02_841#Would you fellas like to join us?
S28E02_845#When did salad get so awful?
S28E02_848#Kale ruined everything.
S28E02_851#You're just like a guy.
S28E02_853#You're funny, you like to eat crap.
S28E02_855#If I may get personal,
S28E02_857#- what's your bowling average? - 212.
S28E02_860#Oh, my God, you're my best friend!
S28E02_862#And that's all. Just friends.
S28E02_864#Eh, we shall see.
S28E02_867#There is one test for a-romance that never fails.
S28E02_870#Enjoy it.
S28E02_877#That is not a-love!
S28E02_880#This is the best... we're friends,
S28E02_882#no one has any reason to get upset,
S28E02_883#and no one gets hurt.
S28E02_885#To no one getting hurt.
S28E02_887#Smash-cut to Marge!
S28E02_889#"Look, Monty, our daughter, the president,
S28E02_891#is delivering her speech."
S28E02_893#Excuse me, do I ever get a joke?
S28E02_895#Keep rolling.
S28E02_898#"Mr. Vice President, Madam Speaker, Chinese Overlords,
S28E02_902#years ago, our forefathers, and foremothers..."
S28E02_905#Stick to the script!
S28E02_907#Oh, you try to give direction to a bunch of land apes
S28E02_909#who aren't worth the ping-pong balls
S28E02_912#stuck to their untalented asses!
S28E02_914#Idiots! Mountebanks!
S28E02_916#Featherwits! Poltroons!
S28E02_919#Saint Francis himself would vomit with rage!
S28E02_923#Okay, you heard him, people.
S28E02_925#That was great, just a little more energy.
S28E02_927#Sir, I know you're getting frustrated,
S28E02_929#so we recorded some future scenarios.
S28E02_931#Yes, let's see what life will be like when I'm old.
S28E02_934#I'm going to build homes for the homeless
S28E02_937#with my boyfriend Sean,
S28E02_939#then it's off to Vassar in the fall.
S28E02_941#Irish boyfriend? Helping the homeless?
S28E02_944#Well, every family has one black sheep.
S28E02_945#Let's move on.
S28E02_947#How did this happen?
S28E02_950#Don't you take that tone with me.
S28E02_953#A Harvard man?
S28E02_955#I was warned there'd be nausea.
S28E02_957#I don't need them. My life is perfect.
S28E02_962#My life is perfect.
S28E02_965#49, 50. My life is perfect!
S28E02_968#Have you seen my Canadian penny?
S28E02_971#Oh, darn it, darn it, darn it!
S28E02_974#Everyone out! You're all fired!
S28E02_977#Having a family is the most meaningless experience
S28E02_978#I could imagine.
S28E02_980#Try acting.
S28E02_982#Come on, kids.
S28E02_983#I'm taking my bathrobe.
S28E02_985#There's a dye pack stitched in.
S28E02_988#Joke's on you. I like this better.
S28E02_990#Oh, go ahead, take your robe.
S28E02_991#But you'll never work in
S28E02_993#single-viewer virtual reality family melodrama again.
S28E02_997#Did you see the guitar lessons sign on the telephone pole?
S28E02_1000#I took a tab.
S28E02_1002#No, I'm not gonna take the lessons,
S28E02_1004#I just needed to blow my nose.
S28E02_1006#Ooh, my family's here. Gotta go.
S28E02_1008#Hey, guys! It's good to see you.
S28E02_1010#Hmm. Good to see you. Who were you talking to?
S28E02_1013#My friend Julia.
S28E02_1015#- Julia? Like a girl? - She's not a girl.
S28E02_1018#She's three years younger than your mother.
S28E02_1021#Now, Marge, it's cool.
S28E02_1023#All we do is share our deepest thoughts and feelings.
S28E02_1027#Kids, could you leave the room, please?
S28E02_1030#Faster!
S28E02_1032#Geronimo!
S28E02_1036#Marge, it's nothing. She's just my new best friend.
S28E02_1042#What the... Why... Why are you mad at those eggs?!
S28E02_1044#They didn't do anything!
S28E02_1047#Homer Simpson!
S28E02_1050#After all I've put up with for all these years,
S28E02_1054#if I'm not your best friend, what is this marriage about?!
S28E02_1057#Okay, okay, you're my best friend.
S28E02_1059#She's just somebody I call when I'm mad at you.
S28E02_1063#I mean, I'm never mad at you.
S28E02_1064#Well, sometimes I'm mad at you.
S28E02_1066#A little bit! But I shouldn't call her.
S28E02_1069#I should just drink it off at Moe's.
S28E02_1071#You'll never hear the name Julia again.
S28E02_1074#Hi, I'm Julia.
S28E02_1076#I just wanted to introduce myself 
S28E02_1078#and tell you you've got a great husband.
S28E02_1081#I've got a nice bicycle, too, but I keep a lock on it.
S28E02_1085#I have no interest in... riding your bike.
S28E02_1088#But I want you to know that your bike loves you
S28E02_1091#as truly as a bike can.
S28E02_1093#And, Marge, I love you as much as that bike.
S28E02_1097#- You are the bike. - Wha...?!
S28E02_1103#I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
S28E02_1105#Apparently, you didn't do anything wrong.
S28E02_1108#But I'm not wrong for getting mad at you either.
S28E02_1111#Marge, Julia taught me lots of stuff that could help us.
S28E02_1114#For example, I realize that when you see me
S28E02_1115#doing something stupid 
S28E02_1117#and you don't say anything about it, you know,
S28E02_1120#and you're just being nice.
S28E02_1123#- That's true. - And when something's bothering you,
S28E02_1126#sometimes I should just say,
S28E02_1129#"I understand," instead of trying to fix it.
S28E02_1132#Because all you really need is someone to know what you're feeling.
S28E02_1136#That is really, really lovely.
S28E02_1142#I have to confess, I did see him naked on the roof.
S28E02_1145#I did, too, and I was at 10,000 feet.
S28E02_1148#Now for the final fantasy.
S28E02_1154#Oh, my love, my love,
S28E02_1157#losing you so young, so beautiful.
S28E02_1160#Still no jokes.
S28E02_1165#I love you, and how.
S28E02_1169#You're too good for heaven, man.
S28E02_1172#Excellent.
S28E02_1181#Welcome, Monty.
S28E02_1183#I'd like to take a selfie with you.
S28E02_1188#All right, but just one.
S28E02_1190#Hmm, it's not plugged in.
S28E03_61#The only reason Boston wins is because they cheat!
S28E03_64#Listening in on our teams' headsets, fattening our cheerleaders.
S28E03_66#You know, for three games last year,
S28E03_68#Boston used a volleyball painted brown.
S28E03_71#That was never proven, you Springfield screw-job.
S28E03_74#Boston fans.
S28E03_76#In town for the Dennis Lehane book tour.
S28E03_79#Go kiss a Kennedy, you rule-breaking cranberry squeezers!
S28E03_81#We don't cheat.
S28E03_84#We won 12 division titles in ten years, fair and square.
S28E03_88#You dorks are just jealous of all our championship rings.
S28E03_93#You're the one who's jealous.
S28E03_95#I only wish I could be as jealous as you.
S28E03_97#Geez, Jay, this place has got more knobs than a hardware store.
S28E03_100#I hate this town.
S28E03_102#So don't I. Friggin' doorknobs.
S28E03_105#Automatic.
S28E03_110#It's fourth and long, the Americans' last chance for a miracle.
S28E03_113#Come on, Springfield, put it away!
S28E03_115#We're gonna win one. We're finally gonna win one!
S28E03_117#The QB handsomely takes the snap,
S28E03_119#sexily steps back to pass,
S28E03_121#and with God-given good looks, fires it downfield!
S28E03_124#But there's no one there to receive it!
S28E03_125#Nice pass.
S28E03_127#What a first-ballot hall-of-fame loser.
S28E03_131#But the ball is caught by the Americans' mascot, Flappy the Flag!
S28E03_134#Flappy running unopposed into the end zone
S28E03_136#for a surely illegal touchdown.
S28E03_138#Throwing to the mascot?
S28E03_141#After further review, Flappy the Flag is listed
S28E03_145#on the Americans' 53-man roster and reported eligible.
S28E03_148#The result of the play is a touchdown.
S28E03_151#Once again, the Americans found a way to win.
S28E03_153#Oh, that'll put a smile on Coach Bonderchuck's face.
S28E03_159#Oh, not again!
S28E03_161#They cheated! You cheated!
S28E03_163#Did not. You got to cover the mascot.
S28E03_165#Use your noggin. Play smart.
S28E03_167#Flappy's on the roster.
S28E03_169#On the roster!
S28E03_172#- On the roster! - On the roster!
S28E03_175#On the roster, my butt.
S28E03_177#Once again, those Boston cheaters 
S28E03_179#think the rules don't apply to them.
S28E03_181#And they're so smug about winning.
S28E03_183#If I ever won anything, I wouldn't be smug about it.
S28E03_186#I'd be class all the way,
S28E03_188#like Mark Harmon... pure American elegance.
S28E03_192#I tell ya, the next Boston fan I see, I'm just gonna lose it.
S28E03_195#Lose it so hard.
S28E03_197#And... What the...
S28E03_199#What is... How could...
S28E03_201#That hat! Your head!
S28E03_203#That team.
S28E03_205#My son!
S28E03_207#Hey, Dad, caught the game last night.
S28E03_209#Tough loss for your guys.
S28E03_210#Guess we just wanted it more.
S28E03_212#Oh, am I in the right house?
S28E03_214#Because no one in my house
S28E03_217#would ever be caught dead wearing Boston Americans gear.
S28E03_220#Dead!
S28E03_222#I feel ya, Homer.
S28E03_223#Sucks to be a loser.
S28E03_226#Unlike the six-time Mega-Bowl champion Boston Americans.
S28E03_230#Ring, ring, ring.
S28E03_232#Give me that hat.
S28E03_240#Ol¨¦!
S28E03_244#Your father never could resist an "Ol¨¦."
S28E03_246#Eh, he'll run out of steam soon.
S28E03_255#Get in.
S28E03_259#Look around, son.
S28E03_261#This is your hometown.
S28E03_263#And the Springfield Atoms are your hometown team...
S28E03_266#Since 2003, when we stole them
S28E03_268#in the middle of the night from Portland.
S28E03_270#What kind of life can you have here 
S28E03_272#as a Boston fan?
S28E03_273#See?
S28E03_276#Why are you wearing that Boston hat?
S28E03_277#This is Atoms country, bro!
S28E03_279#I would pluck out my own eyes 
S28E03_281#if I did not have a call-back
S28E03_284#for a Web-only Olive Garden commercial.
S28E03_290#They're just trying to hat shame me.
S28E03_291#Face it, Dad,

S28E03_295#All those awesome Southies in The Departed,
S28E03_297#those are my people.
S28E03_299#People? The dog and the baby are your people.
S28E03_302#It all goes back to the Boston Tea Party,
S28E03_305#a prank so kick-ass it started a country.
S28E03_309#Come on, pal, what do you say?
S28E03_311#Just lose the hat, for your old man.
S28E03_316#Nope, I think I'll stick with the bad boys.
S28E03_321#Get it off before God sees.
S28E03_331#And the people from Boston are so obnoxious.
S28E03_335#They think their stupid city has the best everything:
S28E03_338#bands, comedians, chowder,
S28E03_340#their so-called cream pies, which are actually cakes.
S28E03_342#- And there's... - Why don't you let me
S28E03_344#take your mind off your problems? 
S28E03_347#And what's with Aerosmith?

S28E03_350#The...
S28E03_364#Do your job, Homer.
S28E03_368#Bart, you're my son.
S28E03_370#There's no neck tattoo so crass,
S28E03_372#no gender reassignment too ambiguous

S28E03_376#Which is why I must show you the error of your ways,
S28E03_380#even if it means dragging this family all the way to hell.
S28E03_384#A vacation to Boston?
S28E03_388#No, not a vay-cation, a hate-cation!
S28E03_391#Where you experience the worst a place has to offer, 
S28E03_394#and then say, "Told ya!"
S28E03_396#Hate-watching, hate-voting
S28E03_397#and now a hate-cation?
S28E03_399#Why can't everyone just enjoy things they like?
S28E03_402#Because things you like
S28E03_404#don't fill you with delicious, delicious rage.
S28E03_406#Hmm, I'm gonna love this trip.
S28E03_408#I'm gonna love it right in your face.
S28E03_410#That's it, build it up in your head.
S28E03_413#High hopes just make the hate-cation stronger.
S28E03_416#You're crazy. Boston can't be that bad.
S28E03_424#I've never loved hating anything so much!

S28E03_439#See, boy?
S28E03_441#Notice how Bostonians aren't exactly ugly,
S28E03_443#but they're not sexy either.
S28E03_446#Homer, your negative attitude is ruining this hate-cation.
S28E03_449#So, what to hate first? The Freedom Trail?
S28E03_452#The touch tank at the New England Aquarium?
S28E03_454#Ooh, that could blow.
S28E03_455#I want to go to Southie.
S28E03_458#That part of town has the towniest townies of any town.

S28E03_480#Out of my way, ladies. You're blocking my shot.
S28E03_482#The seats at Fenway Park are too narrow,

S28E03_497#The cot?
S28E03_499#Cot!
S28E03_504#No, don't struggle!
S28E03_506#It only makes them bobble harder.
S28E03_508#They keep coming. Bobblehead Steven Wright,

S28E03_514#The vibrations are killing him!

S28E03_528#He'll be fine, ma'am.

S28E03_581#Do you vaccinate your children?
S28E03_582#Of course.

S28E03_619#What the crap is this BS?
S28E03_621#What? I thought you'd want to try candlepin bowling.
S28E03_626#Hey, McCarthy, nice half-Worcester.
S28E03_629#Get bent, McDonald.
S28E03_631#A lot of wood to work with out there.
S28E03_632#Boston.
S28E03_634#They even found a way to mess up bowling.
S28E03_636#Just try it.
S28E03_639#Eh, all right.
S28E03_646#None of the usual pain in my knees, back,
S28E03_648#wrist, shoulder, neck, and chest.

S28E03_664#Wait. Hold on.
S28E03_665#Wait.
S28E03_668#What?
S28E03_670#This is candlepin bowling.
S28E03_671#You get three.
S28E03_682#Three balls.
S28E03_684#I see it all so clearly now.
S28E03_687#What, Dad? What is it?
S28E03_689#This regional bowling with its one extra roll
S28E03_693#has knocked my misguided hate into the gutter.
S28E03_697#I like Boston!
S28E03_699#Dad, you and me are real father-son Southies, now.
S28E03_702#Just like Ben and Casey Affleck.

S28E03_734#You know, for a cake,
S28E03_736#this Boston cream pie isn't so bad.
S28E03_739#Look at them. So innocent.
S28E03_741#Not Bart, but go on.
S28E03_743#Homer,
S28E03_745#I never dared dream about living somewhere that values education, 
S28E03_748#with great health care,
S28E03_750#and everyone's outdoorsy but still pallid.
S28E03_752#If it weren't crazy,
S28E03_754#I'd say we should be raising our kids here.
S28E03_756#But no. No, no. That's crazy!
S28E03_758#Is it?
S28E03_761#But I never thought you, of all people...
S28E03_764#Honey, this could be the chance we never thought we'd get.
S28E03_767#The chance to knock down all of life's pins.
S28E03_770#Are you saying what I think you're saying?
S28E03_774#I am. Fate is offering us a third ball.
S28E03_778#Do you mean it? Are we going to move to Boston?
S28E03_781#I knew I didn't pay this month's mortgage for a reason.
S28E03_799#We did it! We really did it! We made a life change.

S28E03_805#Now, I can take a nap standing up.

S28E03_979#if you could have known that Boston was gonna turn out so wussy,

S28E03_1010#Oh, honey, I know it's a big change.

S28E03_1016#with a better life...

S28E03_1081#You know, guys, I've picked out the perfect Boston activity

S28E03_1086#Ooh, a parade.
S28E03_1088#Not just any parade.
S28E03_1090#The Boston Americans?
S28E03_1094#Bonk! Bonk! Bonk!
S28E03_1097#It's a state holiday 
S28E03_1099#because the league overturned the coach's suspension
S28E03_1101#for using magnets to affect the coin toss.
S28E03_1103#Pretty cool way to celebrate our new hometown.
S28E03_1105#Right, Dad?
S28E03_1108#As a Bostonian, I definitely support my team.
S28E03_1114#Hey, Bonk! Can we get a picture?
S28E03_1116#Hell to the derrr, little bro!
S28E03_1120#Come on, Homer, put on the hat.
S28E03_1123#I can support my hometown team without putting on a hat.
S28E03_1126#Hats go on your head!
S28E03_1128#If you're gonna live in Boston, you got to wear the hat.
S28E03_1133#Okay.
S28E03_1140#You did this on purpose.
S28E03_1142#My future is at stake.
S28E03_1144#So don't is mine.
S28E03_1146#Just... a... hat.
S28E03_1149#You can do it, Homie.
S28E03_1150#Think of the candlepins.
S28E03_1152#This is our extra ball!
S28E03_1156#A... better... life.
S28E03_1167#Stupid cheaters!
S28E03_1168#You cheat,
S28E03_1170#you flip out when people say you cheat,
S28E03_1172#and everybody knows
S28E03_1174#you're nothing but a big bunch of cheaters!
S28E03_1179#You made us leave that lovely city
S28E03_1181#rather than just put on a stupid hat.
S28E03_1183#It wasn't even fitted.
S28E03_1185#I just couldn't wear the hat.
S28E03_1187#Well, I'm still mad at you.
S28E03_1189#I never even got to experience one of those Boston winters
S28E03_1192#everyone raves about.
S28E03_1194#Come on, baby, we could never escape our problems
S28E03_1196#by moving somewhere else.
S28E03_1198#Our problems are who we are, not where we are.
S28E03_1201#Well... maybe.
S28E03_1203#The traffic was pretty annoying.
S28E03_1205#Not to mention the unspoken racism.
S28E03_1208#It wasn't that unspoken.
S28E03_1211#At least someone in this family
S28E03_1213#is happy about where they came from.
S28E03_1216#Oh, don't worry, Lisa.
S28E03_1218#You'll get back to Boston someday.
S28E03_1220#What are you talking about?
S28E03_1221#I never left.
S28E03_1223#I'm in Boston now.
S28E03_1227#Welcome home, Lisa.
S28E03_1229#Class is about to start.
S28E01_120#And that's where Lard Lad used to be!
S28E01_123#Oh, looks like we better file a report
S28E01_125#with the Bureau of Missing Statues.
S28E01_127#Yeah. Be like that time that Rodin statue got stolen.
S28E01_130#What was the name of that statue again?
S28E01_132#Ah, let me think.
S28E01_133#Thinkin'.
S28E01_135#Yeah, still thinkin'.
S28E01_137#Still thinkin'.
S28E01_140#Uh, either we can fan out and search,
S28E01_142#or bunch up and riot.
S28E01_144#Oh, balderdash and poppycock. I say we do not riot.
S28E01_146#Riot!
S28E01_148#Don't!
S28E01_149#Riot!
S28E01_150#Don't!
S28E01_152#Riot!
S28E01_165#And thanks to the equal number of nonrioters,
S28E01_168#the total cost of the damage is zero dollars.
S28E01_171#Homer, were you in that riot?
S28E01_172#Marge, please.
S28E01_174#I'm a leader in this community.
S28E01_176#In response to the outcry,
S28E01_178#Lard Lad's parent company,
S28E01_180#Tianjin Mining and Smelting and Donuts,
S28E01_181#has issued the following statement:
S28E01_184#"We are rebranding Lard Lad with an updated statue."
S28E01_187#Rebranding.
S28E01_189#That just means admitting failure, Dad.
S28E01_191#Admitting failure.
S28E01_193#People of Springfield,
S28E01_195#please welcome Mr....
S28E01_197#I know I'm gonna mangle this... Lee Fong.
S28E01_200#Uh, actually, it's pronounced Robert Chan.
S28E01_204#And now, please welcome the model for the original Lard Lad,
S28E01_207#Mr. Laird Lad.
S28E01_209#A lot of crazy names today.
S28E01_213#Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Lard Lad's bold,
S28E01_216#focus-grouped, new look!
S28E01_222#That doesn't say donuts!
S28E01_224#that says management overthink!
S28E01_226#The Thinker!
S28E01_228#That statue's called The Thinker.
S28E01_230#What? What are we on now?
S28E01_231#What?
S28E01_232#People, let's give the new statue a chance.
S28E01_235#When the Eiffel Tower was first built,
S28E01_237#many said it was a steel monstrosity.
S28E01_240#It still is.
S28E01_242#Fine, but maybe this will grow on you.
S28E01_245#- Aw, this thing sucks. - I don't think so.
S28E01_248#Well, at-at-at a certain angle...
S28E01_249#it's beautiful.
S28E01_250#- We love it. - That's beautiful.
S28E01_257#You fools!
S28E01_259#You've erected a massive concave reflective surface.
S28E01_262#It will focus the sun's beam in a deadly ray.
S28E01_283#- Yeah! - Yeah!
S28E01_299#First off, I'd like to thank the good people
S28E01_302#at Tianjin Smelting and Mining and Donuts and Tarps
S28E01_306#for neutralizing our wonderful, deadly, new Lard Lad.
S28E01_309#Yeah, that's great.
S28E01_311#They'll grow back.
S28E01_314#The time for mourning and blaming our mayors has passed.
S28E01_317#We will rebuild.
S28E01_319#We will rebuild.
S28E01_321#We will rebuild.
S28E01_323#We will rebuild!
S28E01_326#We will rebuild!
S28E01_336#We will rebuild.
S28E01_338#We will rebuild.
S28E01_340#I guess there's only one man we can turn to.
S28E01_342#Supergirl?!
S28E01_348#So... you'd like me to save the town.
S28E01_351#Well, you've got gumption, I'll give you that.
S28E01_353#And such an adorable baby,
S28E01_355#it really restores my... my faith in... in the, uh...
S28E01_358#Smithers, where is the damn trapdoor button?
S28E01_361#Mr. Burns, you already trap-doored us
S28E01_364#from your upstairs office.
S28E01_365#Yes.
S28E01_366#And how was your fall?
S28E01_368#Painful? Unexpected?
S28E01_370#- Oh, yeah. - Worst I've ever had.
S28E01_371#- Oh! Really... - Really...
S28E01_372#- Pulled something. - Totally painful.
S28E01_374#Did not see it coming.
S28E01_376#Excellent.
S28E01_380#So... remind me what I was saying no to.
S28E01_383#Funding repairs to the town.
S28E01_385#But if you could do even one little project.
S28E01_388#Reducking the duck pond
S28E01_390#or fixing up the Springfield Bowl.
S28E01_392#The Springfield Bowl.
S28E01_399#Very well.
S28E01_401#I will rebuild this town on one condition.
S28E01_403#Forget it.
S28E01_405#Our desperate plea is nonnegotiable.
S28E01_407#I want to put on a variety show at the Bowl.
S28E01_410#A celebration of everything wonderful about...
S28E01_412#what's the name of this town again?
S28E01_413#Springfield, sir.
S28E01_415#Yes, I will destroy Springfield.
S28E01_417#Celebrate, sir.
S28E01_419#Fine, we will try your way first.
S28E01_423#Springfield has risen from the ashes like a phoenix.
S28E01_425#That's phoenix, the mythical bird,
S28E01_428#not Phoenix, the cultureless, Mars-scape of the Southwest.
S28E01_431#Our unlikely angel,
S28E01_433#the devil himself, C. Montgomery Burns.
S28E01_435#Thank you, Kent.
S28E01_439#And don't forget the open auditions
S28E01_441#for my Springfield Follies.
S28E01_443#This year women may audition, too,
S28E01_444#with permission of husband,
S28E01_446#father and pastor in writing.
S28E01_449#Next.
S28E01_460#*Un bel di, vedremo*
S28E01_467#*Levarsi un fil di fumo*
S28E01_471#Puccini's a little well-trod, don't you think?
S28E01_475#This isn't right.
S28E01_477#This isn't how it was at all.
S28E01_479#I remember that night so vividly.
S28E01_485#Monty, time to go on stage.
S28E01_486#Yes, Mama.
S28E01_488#Your little butterscotch drop won't let you down.
S28E01_491#Aw, who's candy?
S28E01_492#You's candy.
S28E01_494#Oh, I'm gonna lick you, my sweet little lolly.
S28E01_496#Who likes Mommy's licks?
S28E01_498#Monty likes Mommy's licks.
S28E01_499#Lickity, lickity, lick.
S28E01_506#But the butterscotch soon turned to bitter squelch.
S28E01_509#I want everything just as it was back then.
S28E01_511#The stage filled with children
S28E01_512#like those from 1913.
S28E01_514#High-spirited, snaggletoothed,
S28E01_516#and willing to work 18 hours a day.
S28E01_517#Attention.
S28E01_520#An old man is prowling the school, looking for young children.
S28E01_522#Please, perform for him.
S28E01_525#Watch me make this nerd disappear.
S28E01_529#Also...
S28E01_531#Excellent villain.
S28E01_532#And my cast is complete.
S28E01_534#I'll just save the list and...
S28E01_539#Samson himself could not pry open these jaws.
S28E01_541#Can I help you, sir?
S28E01_543#Oh, women aren't meant for clasp opening.
S28E01_548#Young lady, if there's one thing I know about show business,
S28E01_551#it's that there are a lot of clipboards.
S28E01_553#How would you like to be my assistant director?
S28E01_557#And I'll be perfectly positioned
S28E01_559#to find out exactly what Mr. Burns is really up to.
S28E01_561#I'm in.
S28E01_563#And if you need another act,
S28E01_565#I also play this.
S28E01_566#There's no room in my show
S28E01_568#for Adolphe Sax's vile-sounding o-phone.
S28E01_571#Do you ever say anything in a simple way?
S28E01_572#Shut up.
S28E01_574#Well, that was clear.
S28E01_577#Hey, Homer, are you sure we haven't let the plant
S28E01_579#slip with Mr. Burns gone?
S28E01_581#Smitty, as a wise, old man once said,
S28E01_583#"Out with the old...
S28E01_585#and in with the brew."
S28E01_618#That's enough.
S28E01_620#But I haven't started my act.
S28E01_622#Muntz, what have you got?
S28E01_623#A rabbit in a bag.
S28E01_625#Ooh, a promising magic trick.
S28E01_627#No, it's my lunch.
S28E01_629#Bah! You're all incompetent.
S28E01_631#I won't go through this a second time.
S28E01_632#Second time?
S28E01_634#Is there something you're not telling us?
S28E01_635#A vast amount.
S28E01_637#And what part of "What I've never told you"
S28E01_639#Don't you understand?
S28E01_649#Mother, what is that sound they're making?
S28E01_650#Well, it's called laughter.
S28E01_652#You're a laughingstock, Charles.
S28E01_654#Oh, oh, it's awful.
S28E01_657#This show isn't good enough.
S28E01_659#No show could be good enough.
S28E01_661#It's not?
S28E01_670#What are you doing?
S28E01_672#Getting ready for Monday.
S28E01_675#I'm gonna fill a Super Soaker full of lemonade,
S28E01_677#Carl's gonna fill one with iced tea,
S28E01_679#and we're gonna Arnold Palmer Lenny
S28E01_681#when he walks in.
S28E01_686#Arnold Palmer Lenny.
S28E01_688#You're going to Arnold Palmer Lenny.
S28E01_692#Yeah, you see, Arnold Palmer was a golfer
S28E01_695#and he made up this drink
S28E01_697#where it's not a full glass of lemonade
S28E01_700#or a full glass of iced tea.
S28E01_702#Instead...
S28E01_704#Homie, I'm worried about all this silliness at work.
S28E01_707#You're the safety inspector.
S28E01_709#I'm a safety inspector.
S28E01_711#Not the.
S28E01_712#I've never seen another.
S28E01_714#What... wait, one safety inspector?
S28E01_716#For the whole nuclear plant?
S28E01_718#That's insane.
S28E01_721#Put everything in the car and get out of town.
S28E01_723#I'll find you, if there are still roads!
S28E01_725#Sweetie, sweetie,
S28E01_727#all you've got to do is be responsible.
S28E01_729#Your friends consider you the leader
S28E01_731#because you're a little taller.
S28E01_736#With above-average height comes above-average responsibility.
S28E01_739#Marge, thank you for setting me straight.
S28E01_741#You're welcome.
S28E01_744#Okay, I want to open this show
S28E01_746#with someone being shot into a cannon.
S28E01_750#You're joking, right?
S28E01_753#Well, because, see, that's impossible.
S28E01_762#Everyone, little miss nitpick hates the show,
S28E01_764#so I'm shutting it down.
S28E01_768#This was an act.
S28E01_769#Now it's just bullying.
S28E01_779#Thanks a lot, Lisa.
S28E01_781#We were getting out of school for this.
S28E01_787#Well if isn't the little girl that made a billionaire cry.
S28E01_789#May I please speak with Mr. Burns?
S28E01_791#No, he's very busy.
S28E01_795#Won't you please come back and do the show?
S28E01_797#Shan't.
S28E01_803#Oh, that bell has quite the recoil.
S28E01_806#Oh, what is bothering him?
S28E01_808#And what were those weird lines around his eyes?
S28E01_810#I know.
S28E01_812#It's such a tragedy on that beautiful face.
S28E01_815#Come here.
S28E01_817#Well, there's only one explanation for those lines, Lisa.
S28E01_820#He's been watching something on the Mutoscope.
S28E01_825#So, if I play this,
S28E01_827#I'll know the answer.
S28E01_829#It, uh, costs a nickel.
S28E01_854#So this is what made Mr. Burns the monster he is.
S28E01_858#Within days
S28E01_860#half of America was cranking to my bottom.
S28E01_863#I think you're trying to make up for what happened to you then
S28E01_865#by putting on a perfect Bowl show now.
S28E01_868#Spare me your amateur psychology.
S28E01_870#"Ooh, I saw my father decapitated by a grain harvester
S28E01_873#"And now I can't enjoy wheat. Boohoo."
S28E01_877#Mr. Burns, I want you to listen to that crowd.
S28E01_885#Do you really want to let those happy, joyous people win?
S28E01_894#Smithers, locate my dickey.
S28E01_895#We've got a show to do.
S28E01_897#*I was gonna clean my room*
S28E01_899#*Until I got high*
S28E01_902#*I was gonna get up and find the broom*
S28E01_904#*But then...*
S28E01_906#Springfield Nuclear.
S28E01_908#Yes, yes, sir, I'll alert the workers...
S28E01_910#that the pizzas are here!
S28E01_914#Oh, yeah, here he comes.
S28E01_916#The life of this party!
S28E01_919#Who wants to get back to work?
S28E01_921#What?
S28E01_924#We are a public trust.
S28E01_926#We bring power to people's homes.
S28E01_930#Lightbulbs, toasters, and that's all I can think of.
S28E01_933#Now let's buckle down!
S28E01_937#Okay, Homer, just let us get our microwave popcorn
S28E01_939#out of the core.
S28E01_940#You're only supposed to do that
S28E01_942#when we're watching a movie in the core.
S28E01_970#Thank you, thank you.
S28E01_971#Well, that's the easiest time
S28E01_973#anyone's had parking at the Springfield Bowl.
S28E01_976#Don't you laugh at me!
S28E01_979#Now, enjoy the show.
S28E01_982#God always liked you best.
S28E01_984#No, God loves everyone equally.
S28E01_987#That's wonderful news.
S28E01_990#Enough of your tomfoolery, Todd.
S28E01_992#Let's sing.
S28E01_994#*Michael, row your boat ashore*
S28E01_998#*Hallelujah*
S28E01_1001#*Michael, row your boat ashore*
S28E01_1004#*Hallelu...*
S28E01_1008#Say, Sockie, who was that lady I saw you with last night?
S28E01_1011#That was no lady.
S28E01_1013#That was your mother.
S28E01_1015#Oh, she'll date anyone.
S28E01_1017#Why won't she give me a stable home?
S28E01_1033#Um, this is just a simple twins trick.
S28E01_1035#They pulled the other twin out of the tank
S28E01_1037#behind the curtain.
S28E01_1046#Wait, that wasn't part of the show.
S28E01_1049#No. No, it's not fair!
S28E01_1051#I was good!
S28E01_1052#Arnold.
S28E01_1053#Palmer!
S28E01_1057#Fantastic.
S28E01_1059#What a finale, eh, Mr. Burns?
S28E01_1061#Childhood trauma cured, huh, huh?
S28E01_1064#That wasn't the finale.
S28E01_1071#Maestro, "Golden Slippers," if you please.
S28E01_1073#Ooh, boy.
S28E01_1080#We can't let him make a fool of himself again.
S28E01_1083#No, no, Mr. Burns needs to do this.
S28E01_1089#*Oh, dem golden slippers*
S28E01_1091#*Oh, dem gold...*
S28E01_1094#The burn.
S28E01_1096#Mr. Burns can't take the impact of that many photons.
S28E01_1099#Those light-shining fools!
S28E01_1108#Oh, for a murder of crows
S28E01_1111#to pluck out mine eyes!
S28E01_1112#You.
S28E01_1113#This show was your fault.
S28E01_1115#Well, you'd better know this, mister.
S28E01_1117#This town has my back.
S28E01_1118#And... hey.
S28E01_1120#Where did they go?
S28E01_1122#How did 15,000 people leave so fast?
S28E01_1126#Want to see me do a cartwheel?
S28E01_1132#Always had trouble with those.
S28E01_1135#Oh, I can't stay mad at you.
S28E01_1137#At my age, I can't stay anything at anybody.
S28E01_1139#Oh, and you know what?
S28E01_1141#The laughter in my head is gone.
S28E01_1143#Go ahead, blow your German kazoo.
S28E01_1145#Yes, sir!
S28E01_1150#Smithers, tap my foot for me.
S28E01_1152#With impatience.
S28E01_1154#Now, lift my arm so I can check my watch.
S28E01_1156#Oh, you really should start doing
S28E01_1157#some of these things yourself.
S28E01_1163#Dad, why do Simpsons always fail?
S28E01_1166#Oh, sweetie pie,
S28E01_1168#it's a terrible curse that goes back centuries.
S28E01_1172#No, no!
S28E01_1173#Don't answer that.
S28E01_1175#We just need a place to stay for the night.
S28E01_1178#Oh, shouldn't we help them?
S28E01_1180#Hey, in Zero BC, you can't trust anybody.
S28E01_1183#Curse them, Mary!
S28E01_1185#You curse them, my water just broke!
S28E01_1186#Please?
S28E01_1193#You're telling me that really happened?
S28E01_1195#They looked just like us, didn't they?
S28E01_1209#Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's all, folks!
S28E02_126#That is my family...people who love me.
S28E02_129#Yes, you're right.
S28E02_131#I should consider encasing people in plastic.
S28E02_133#Then I could always see the look of fear in their faces.
S28E02_136#Yeah, we're finished here. Get out.
S28E02_138#May I remind you I'm paying you five dollars an hour?
S28E02_140#Oi! Why did I lock in at that rate?
S28E02_148#What?
S28E02_153#Hmm. No pulse. Oh, wait, that's me.
S28E02_158#Dead. So sad. He was a true friend.
S28E02_162#Excellent.
S28E02_167#I can't believe Dr. Nussbaum's dead.
S28E02_170#Um, we've had a lot of therapists.
S28E02_173#Which one was he again?
S28E02_175#He was the one who helped us communicate.
S28E02_178#- You never listen to a word I say! - I have to listen all day at work.
S28E02_181#- You're not listening now. - I'm listened out!
S28E02_182#- What? "Listened out." - Not listening...
S28E02_184#- What does that even mean? - Not listening,  
S28E02_186#Let's hear what the children have to say.
S28E02_188#- I'm gonna wet the bed to get their attention. - Not listening...
S28E02_190#You're the one sleeping in it.
S28E02_192#I didn't say I'd wet my bed.
S28E02_194#Please, Marge! Do we have to burden
S28E02_196#Dr. Nussbaum with our problems?
S28E02_198#- Maggie talk! - The man has problems of his own!
S28E02_200#Maggie talk!
S28E02_204#No one listen? Maggie never talk again.
S28E02_208#- That's not what happened. - That's exactly what happened.
S28E02_210#I believe I remember what happened, Marge. - How could you remember?
S28E02_213#You were looking at your phone half the time.
S28E02_215#When you have four bar Wi-Fi, you use it!
S28E02_218#Oh, look. It's the ugly people from the cube.
S28E02_220#Uh, if we can begin.
S28E02_222#Oh, of course.
S28E02_224#Oh, this man meant a great deal to me.
S28E02_226#And helping out with the cost of this service 
S28E02_227#was the least I could do.
S28E02_228#Very sweet.
S28E02_229#Smithers?
S28E02_234#For shame!
S28E02_243#Stoned at a funeral.
S28E02_245#Ooh, wow! Where's the funeral?
S28E02_249#Oh! Just what I wanted.
S28E02_251#Just get me home quickly.
S28E02_259#And this year's Nobel Prize for Physics goes to...
S28E02_262#Professor John Frink.
S28E02_271#Ah, thank you, Queen Sonya, and all the people at HBO...
S28E02_274#the, uh, Higgs Boson Observatory.
S28E02_276#You'll see there.
S28E02_278#Oi! Oiven!
S28E02_280#I-I didn't mean to hit him, sir.
S28E02_282#Well, how could a man in his right mind
S28E02_284#miss a car heading right towards him?
S28E02_286#Idiot!
S28E02_288#I think it's this headpiece he's wearing, sir.
S28E02_291#If I may ask, what makes this device so enchanting
S28E02_294#that you ignore the real world?
S28E02_296#Is there a milkmaid skipping rope?
S28E02_302#Oi! Gloivick!
S28E02_304#The Oculus Frink... or Froculus...
S28E02_308#provides you with a complete virtual reality experience.
S28E02_311#Letting you live in a world of your dreams.
S28E02_319#To adjust the focus, turn the dial on the side.
S28E02_325#Now for the after-party!
S28E02_335#I must have it!
S28E02_337#Oh, uh, can you drop me off first?
S28E02_354#Not bad. Next?
S28E02_356#This is still a new technology, sir.
S28E02_358#At the moment, it's really just lots of pornography,
S28E02_361#a roller coaster, pornography, pornography,
S28E02_363#Burger King ad, pornography,
S28E02_364#and... and this one.
S28E02_376#Dragon porn.
S28E02_381#Oh, flame on, baby.
S28E02_382#Flame on!
S28E02_383#Hot! Hot!
S28E02_385#Don't tell my wife, okay?
S28E02_386#Oh, sorry, sir.
S28E02_388#This one is also pornography.
S28E02_389#Oh, so boring.
S28E02_392#Trim those nails, Smithers.
S28E02_394#Uh, sir, if I might suggest,
S28E02_396#the last thing your therapist said was,
S28E02_398#"You need a family."
S28E02_400#I don't need anyone.
S28E02_402#We could program a virtual family for you, sir.
S28E02_406#A virtual family. Yes.
S28E02_407#Meanwhile, let me see the one again
S28E02_409#where I shoot the beloved lion in Africa.
S28E02_411#That was reality, sir.
S28E02_413#I've lived quite the life.
S28E02_415#Quite the life.
S28E02_420#We only need three children, thanks.
S28E02_422#Oh, what kind of coal mine you runnin'?
S28E02_426#You, wife, look at me lovingly,
S28E02_429#as if I'm your husband.
S28E02_431#Can you ask for a look of indifference?
S28E02_433#I think she can do that.
S28E02_435#Luann, pretend it's my birthday.
S28E02_437#Next.
S28E02_439#You promised me a job, Dad!
S28E02_441#I was gonna buy a fat Barbie.
S28E02_443#It's Curvy Barbie.
S28E02_445#And that would mean you have to buy all new clothes.
S28E02_449#This thing says all families in the plant
S28E02_451#are required to try out.
S28E02_452#So far, so good.
S28E02_454#Two-and-a-half children, wife with current hairstyle.
S28E02_456#You're all hired.
S28E02_458#Except you, fatso. We don't need a father.
S28E02_460#I'll be the rooster in this henhouse.
S28E02_462#That is so disappointing.
S28E02_464#I've always wanted to work for Mr. Burns.
S28E02_470#Okay, family scene.
S28E02_472#And... action.
S28E02_486#This isn't a word I use lightly, but... excellent.
S28E02_489#Oh, Smithers, one favor:
S28E02_491#make the children look like they're mine.
S28E02_495#No, no, no! It's too beautiful.
S28E02_498#Like a Supreme Court full of Scalias.
S28E02_499#Switch to something else.
S28E02_507#That's good.
S28E02_508#What's the matter, Homer?
S28E02_510#Last night, Marge and the kids
S28E02_512#didn't get home till 11:00 at night.
S28E02_514#When I came back from Moe's at 11:05,
S28E02_516#they were still taking off their coats!
S28E02_519#I hear old man Burns is just living in a fantasy world now.
S28E02_521#En garde!
S28E02_523#Must be nice.
S28E02_525#Hey, there he is. Wonder what he's watching now.
S28E02_527#Home movies.
S28E02_531#*Happy birthday, dear Burnsie*
S28E02_536#*Happy birthday to you*
S28E02_540#*And maybe more*
S28E02_542#Thank you, thank you.
S28E02_544#Now, your mother's going to take me upstairs
S28E02_546#to give me... her present.
S28E02_553#Oh, Smithers, could you remove the ankle bar?
S28E02_556#More. More. More.
S28E02_562#That was wonderful.
S28E02_564#I'm picking up your ten-year options.
S28E02_566#Ten years?!
S28E02_568#Oh, now, now, no discussion.
S28E02_570#We're a family now.
S28E02_573#What is that? A river otter?
S28E02_580#We're not coming home, Homie.
S28E02_582#What? What do I do without you here?
S28E02_585#You can do what you did with me there: 
S28E02_587#go to Moe's.
S28E02_588#Aw, it's not the same
S28E02_590#if I'm not trying to avoid some unpleasant chore.
S28E02_593#Oh. You could clean out the attic.
S28E02_594#Going to Moe's!
S28E02_597#Eh, no one to go home to, huh?
S28E02_599#Yeah, take it from me, that's rough.
S28E02_600#Yeah.
S28E02_602#Heading back to an empty house.
S28E02_604#No one there to tell you what to do,
S28E02_605#no kids fighting all the time.
S28E02_607#Wait a minute.
S28E02_609#I can eat dinner in any room of the house!
S28E02_611#And not the scary ones like the basement and Bart's bedroom.
S28E02_614#And I can drink at home!
S28E02_616#Whoa, whoa! You're twisting my words there.
S28E02_618#That would be cheaper! And I wouldn't have to drive!
S28E02_620#And you are kind of mean.
S28E02_622#No one calls me mean.
S28E02_626#Moe, you're proving my point.
S28E02_628#Here we are talking, and you pull a shotgun on me.
S28E02_630#But there's never any bullets in this. Watch.
S28E02_634#Ha! Good gag, huh?
S28E02_694#Mmm, does that turn you on?
S28E02_696#Oh, yes. That's hot.
S28E02_700#The perfect temperature.
S28E02_706#Ah, Snoopy knew what he was doing, all right.
S28E02_708#How you doing?
S28E02_711#Don't worry, I've seen you naked plenty of times.
S28E02_714#I live in the house behind yours.
S28E02_716#I don't think my wife would like this.
S28E02_718#Hey, I got a boyfriend, 
S28E02_720#and you're not my type.
S28E02_721#Could you both keep it down?
S28E02_722#I'm trying to count pennies.
S28E02_725#Stupid Flanders.
S28E02_727#Oh! You made me lose count.
S28E02_731#Homer, it looks like you're out of beer, pal.
S28E02_736#Wow, can a man just be friends with a woman?
S28E02_738#Here are some pretzels.
S28E02_740#Yes, he can!
S28E02_746#Aw, don't worry. I'll fix that.
S28E02_749#Have one. I'm celebrating.
S28E02_751#My boyfriend proposed.
S28E02_754#Wow! You'll get to enjoy the most magical part of married life: 
S28E02_757#the beginning.
S28E02_761#So, uh, where's the lucky guy?
S28E02_763#Gone for the weekend.
S28E02_764#He's an airline pilot.
S28E02_766#Maybe he and I can go out for beers - before a flight. 
S28E02_769#Where's your wife?
S28E02_771#Uh, she's staying at this billionaire's house,
S28E02_774#working as a virtual reality actress.
S28E02_775#You know, the usual.
S28E02_777#Oh, Homer?
S28E02_779#Something's going on with Homer.
S28E02_781#My spousal sense is tingling.
S28E02_783#Mom, you blew the take!
S28E02_785#Okay, that's it. I'll direct.
S28E02_787#And I'll show you how a pro does it.
S28E02_789#You, daughter character, say you love me.
S28E02_790#I love you.
S28E02_791#Like you mean it.
S28E02_793#I really love you.
S28E02_794#Once more, with feeling.
S28E02_798#I... really... love... you.
S28E02_803#This girl has no chops whatsoever.
S28E02_805#The existence of my chops
S28E02_807#is not for the likes of you to ascertain, my good sir.
S28E02_811#Would you like some eggs with that ham?
S28E02_819#Looks like the old make-out king's got a new queen, huh?
S28E02_822#Guys, we're just friends.
S28E02_824#It's purely catatonic.
S28E02_825#"Platonic."
S28E02_827#That means she's into me, but I'm keeping it cool.
S28E02_830#I like you, but that's not what it means.
S28E02_833#Sure, right.
S28E02_836#Here you go, the antipasto, to share.
S28E02_841#Would you fellas like to join us?
S28E02_845#When did salad get so awful?
S28E02_848#Kale ruined everything.
S28E02_851#You're just like a guy.
S28E02_853#You're funny, you like to eat crap.
S28E02_855#If I may get personal,
S28E02_857#- what's your bowling average? - 212.
S28E02_860#Oh, my God, you're my best friend!
S28E02_862#And that's all. Just friends.
S28E02_864#Eh, we shall see.
S28E02_867#There is one test for a-romance that never fails.
S28E02_870#Enjoy it.
S28E02_877#That is not a-love!
S28E02_880#This is the best... we're friends,
S28E02_882#no one has any reason to get upset,
S28E02_883#and no one gets hurt.
S28E02_885#To no one getting hurt.
S28E02_887#Smash-cut to Marge!
S28E02_889#"Look, Monty, our daughter, the president,
S28E02_891#is delivering her speech."
S28E02_893#Excuse me, do I ever get a joke?
S28E02_895#Keep rolling.
S28E02_898#"Mr. Vice President, Madam Speaker, Chinese Overlords,
S28E02_902#years ago, our forefathers, and foremothers..."
S28E02_905#Stick to the script!
S28E02_907#Oh, you try to give direction to a bunch of land apes
S28E02_909#who aren't worth the ping-pong balls
S28E02_912#stuck to their untalented asses!
S28E02_914#Idiots! Mountebanks!
S28E02_916#Featherwits! Poltroons!
S28E02_919#Saint Francis himself would vomit with rage!
S28E02_923#Okay, you heard him, people.
S28E02_925#That was great, just a little more energy.
S28E02_927#Sir, I know you're getting frustrated,
S28E02_929#so we recorded some future scenarios.
S28E02_931#Yes, let's see what life will be like when I'm old.
S28E02_934#I'm going to build homes for the homeless
S28E02_937#with my boyfriend Sean,
S28E02_939#then it's off to Vassar in the fall.
S28E02_941#Irish boyfriend? Helping the homeless?
S28E02_944#Well, every family has one black sheep.
S28E02_945#Let's move on.
S28E02_947#How did this happen?
S28E02_950#Don't you take that tone with me.
S28E02_953#A Harvard man?
S28E02_955#I was warned there'd be nausea.
S28E02_957#I don't need them. My life is perfect.
S28E02_962#My life is perfect.
S28E02_965#49, 50. My life is perfect!
S28E02_968#Have you seen my Canadian penny?
S28E02_971#Oh, darn it, darn it, darn it!
S28E02_974#Everyone out! You're all fired!
S28E02_977#Having a family is the most meaningless experience
S28E02_978#I could imagine.
S28E02_980#Try acting.
S28E02_982#Come on, kids.
S28E02_983#I'm taking my bathrobe.
S28E02_985#There's a dye pack stitched in.
S28E02_988#Joke's on you. I like this better.
S28E02_990#Oh, go ahead, take your robe.
S28E02_991#But you'll never work in
S28E02_993#single-viewer virtual reality family melodrama again.
S28E02_997#Did you see the guitar lessons sign on the telephone pole?
S28E02_1000#I took a tab.
S28E02_1002#No, I'm not gonna take the lessons,
S28E02_1004#I just needed to blow my nose.
S28E02_1006#Ooh, my family's here. Gotta go.
S28E02_1008#Hey, guys! It's good to see you.
S28E02_1010#Hmm. Good to see you. Who were you talking to?
S28E02_1013#My friend Julia.
S28E02_1015#- Julia? Like a girl? - She's not a girl.
S28E02_1018#She's three years younger than your mother.
S28E02_1021#Now, Marge, it's cool.
S28E02_1023#All we do is share our deepest thoughts and feelings.
S28E02_1027#Kids, could you leave the room, please?
S28E02_1030#Faster!
S28E02_1032#Geronimo!
S28E02_1036#Marge, it's nothing. She's just my new best friend.
S28E02_1042#What the... Why... Why are you mad at those eggs?!
S28E02_1044#They didn't do anything!
S28E02_1047#Homer Simpson!
S28E02_1050#After all I've put up with for all these years,
S28E02_1054#if I'm not your best friend, what is this marriage about?!
S28E02_1057#Okay, okay, you're my best friend.
S28E02_1059#She's just somebody I call when I'm mad at you.
S28E02_1063#I mean, I'm never mad at you.
S28E02_1064#Well, sometimes I'm mad at you.
S28E02_1066#A little bit! But I shouldn't call her.
S28E02_1069#I should just drink it off at Moe's.
S28E02_1071#You'll never hear the name Julia again.
S28E02_1074#Hi, I'm Julia.
S28E02_1076#I just wanted to introduce myself 
S28E02_1078#and tell you you've got a great husband.
S28E02_1081#I've got a nice bicycle, too, but I keep a lock on it.
S28E02_1085#I have no interest in... riding your bike.
S28E02_1088#But I want you to know that your bike loves you
S28E02_1091#as truly as a bike can.
S28E02_1093#And, Marge, I love you as much as that bike.
S28E02_1097#- You are the bike. - Wha...?!
S28E02_1103#I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
S28E02_1105#Apparently, you didn't do anything wrong.
S28E02_1108#But I'm not wrong for getting mad at you either.
S28E02_1111#Marge, Julia taught me lots of stuff that could help us.
S28E02_1114#For example, I realize that when you see me
S28E02_1115#doing something stupid 
S28E02_1117#and you don't say anything about it, you know,
S28E02_1120#and you're just being nice.
S28E02_1123#- That's true. - And when something's bothering you,
S28E02_1126#sometimes I should just say,
S28E02_1129#"I understand," instead of trying to fix it.
S28E02_1132#Because all you really need is someone to know what you're feeling.
S28E02_1136#That is really, really lovely.
S28E02_1142#I have to confess, I did see him naked on the roof.
S28E02_1145#I did, too, and I was at 10,000 feet.
S28E02_1148#Now for the final fantasy.
S28E02_1154#Oh, my love, my love,
S28E02_1157#losing you so young, so beautiful.
S28E02_1160#Still no jokes.
S28E02_1165#I love you, and how.
S28E02_1169#You're too good for heaven, man.
S28E02_1172#Excellent.
S28E02_1181#Welcome, Monty.
S28E02_1183#I'd like to take a selfie with you.
S28E02_1188#All right, but just one.
S28E02_1190#Hmm, it's not plugged in.
S28E03_61#The only reason Boston wins is because they cheat!
S28E03_64#Listening in on our teams' headsets, fattening our cheerleaders.
S28E03_66#You know, for three games last year,
S28E03_68#Boston used a volleyball painted brown.
S28E03_71#That was never proven, you Springfield screw-job.
S28E03_74#Boston fans.
S28E03_76#In town for the Dennis Lehane book tour.
S28E03_79#Go kiss a Kennedy, you rule-breaking cranberry squeezers!
S28E03_81#We don't cheat.
S28E03_84#We won 12 division titles in ten years, fair and square.
S28E03_88#You dorks are just jealous of all our championship rings.
S28E03_93#You're the one who's jealous.
S28E03_95#I only wish I could be as jealous as you.
S28E03_97#Geez, Jay, this place has got more knobs than a hardware store.
S28E03_100#I hate this town.
S28E03_102#So don't I. Friggin' doorknobs.
S28E03_105#Automatic.
S28E03_110#It's fourth and long, the Americans' last chance for a miracle.
S28E03_113#Come on, Springfield, put it away!
S28E03_115#We're gonna win one. We're finally gonna win one!
S28E03_117#The QB handsomely takes the snap,
S28E03_119#sexily steps back to pass,
S28E03_121#and with God-given good looks, fires it downfield!
S28E03_124#But there's no one there to receive it!
S28E03_125#Nice pass.
S28E03_127#What a first-ballot hall-of-fame loser.
S28E03_131#But the ball is caught by the Americans' mascot, Flappy the Flag!
S28E03_134#Flappy running unopposed into the end zone
S28E03_136#for a surely illegal touchdown.
S28E03_138#Throwing to the mascot?
S28E03_141#After further review, Flappy the Flag is listed
S28E03_145#on the Americans' 53-man roster and reported eligible.
S28E03_148#The result of the play is a touchdown.
S28E03_151#Once again, the Americans found a way to win.
S28E03_153#Oh, that'll put a smile on Coach Bonderchuck's face.
S28E03_159#Oh, not again!
S28E03_161#They cheated! You cheated!
S28E03_163#Did not. You got to cover the mascot.
S28E03_165#Use your noggin. Play smart.
S28E03_167#Flappy's on the roster.
S28E03_169#On the roster!
S28E03_172#- On the roster! - On the roster!
S28E03_175#On the roster, my butt.
S28E03_177#Once again, those Boston cheaters 
S28E03_179#think the rules don't apply to them.
S28E03_181#And they're so smug about winning.
S28E03_183#If I ever won anything, I wouldn't be smug about it.
S28E03_186#I'd be class all the way,
S28E03_188#like Mark Harmon... pure American elegance.
S28E03_192#I tell ya, the next Boston fan I see, I'm just gonna lose it.
S28E03_195#Lose it so hard.
S28E03_197#And... What the...
S28E03_199#What is... How could...
S28E03_201#That hat! Your head!
S28E03_203#That team.
S28E03_205#My son!
S28E03_207#Hey, Dad, caught the game last night.
S28E03_209#Tough loss for your guys.
S28E03_210#Guess we just wanted it more.
S28E03_212#Oh, am I in the right house?
S28E03_214#Because no one in my house
S28E03_217#would ever be caught dead wearing Boston Americans gear.
S28E03_220#Dead!
S28E03_222#I feel ya, Homer.
S28E03_223#Sucks to be a loser.
S28E03_226#Unlike the six-time Mega-Bowl champion Boston Americans.
S28E03_230#Ring, ring, ring.
S28E03_232#Give me that hat.
S28E03_240#Ol¨¦!
S28E03_244#Your father never could resist an "Ol¨¦."
S28E03_246#Eh, he'll run out of steam soon.
S28E03_255#Get in.
S28E03_259#Look around, son.
S28E03_261#This is your hometown.
S28E03_263#And the Springfield Atoms are your hometown team...
S28E03_266#Since 2003, when we stole them
S28E03_268#in the middle of the night from Portland.
S28E03_270#What kind of life can you have here 
S28E03_272#as a Boston fan?
S28E03_273#See?
S28E03_276#Why are you wearing that Boston hat?
S28E03_277#This is Atoms country, bro!
S28E03_279#I would pluck out my own eyes 
S28E03_281#if I did not have a call-back
S28E03_284#for a Web-only Olive Garden commercial.
S28E03_290#They're just trying to hat shame me.
S28E03_291#Face it, Dad, 
S28E03_293#Boston is the Bart Simpson of cities.
S28E03_295#All those awesome Southies in The Departed,
S28E03_297#those are my people.
S28E03_299#People? The dog and the baby are your people.
S28E03_302#It all goes back to the Boston Tea Party,
S28E03_305#a prank so kick-ass it started a country.
S28E03_309#Come on, pal, what do you say?
S28E03_311#Just lose the hat, for your old man.
S28E03_316#Nope, I think I'll stick with the bad boys.
S28E03_321#Get it off before God sees.
S28E03_331#And the people from Boston are so obnoxious.
S28E03_335#They think their stupid city has the best everything:
S28E03_338#bands, comedians, chowder,
S28E03_340#their so-called cream pies, which are actually cakes.
S28E03_342#- And there's... - Why don't you let me
S28E03_344#take your mind off your problems? 
S28E03_347#And what's with Aerosmith?
S28E03_349#That's not how you spell "Arrow."
S28E03_350#The...
S28E03_364#Do your job, Homer.
S28E03_368#Bart, you're my son.
S28E03_370#There's no neck tattoo so crass,
S28E03_372#no gender reassignment too ambiguous
S28E03_374#that I would not love you.
S28E03_376#Which is why I must show you the error of your ways,
S28E03_380#even if it means dragging this family all the way to hell.
S28E03_384#A vacation to Boston?
S28E03_388#No, not a vay-cation, a hate-cation!
S28E03_391#Where you experience the worst a place has to offer, 
S28E03_394#and then say, "Told ya!"
S28E03_396#Hate-watching, hate-voting
S28E03_397#and now a hate-cation?
S28E03_399#Why can't everyone just enjoy things they like?
S28E03_402#Because things you like
S28E03_404#don't fill you with delicious, delicious rage.
S28E03_406#Hmm, I'm gonna love this trip.
S28E03_408#I'm gonna love it right in your face.
S28E03_410#That's it, build it up in your head.
S28E03_413#High hopes just make the hate-cation stronger.
S28E03_416#You're crazy. Boston can't be that bad.
S28E03_424#I've never loved hating anything so much!
S28E03_427#Move your garbage car!
S28E03_429#I got to get to the packy before the B's drop puck!
S28E03_433#Told ya!
S28E03_439#See, boy?
S28E03_441#Notice how Bostonians aren't exactly ugly,
S28E03_443#but they're not sexy either.
S28E03_446#Homer, your negative attitude is ruining this hate-cation.
S28E03_449#So, what to hate first? The Freedom Trail?
S28E03_452#The touch tank at the New England Aquarium?
S28E03_454#Ooh, that could blow.
S28E03_455#I want to go to Southie.
S28E03_458#That part of town has the towniest townies of any town.
S28E03_461#You think your Bostonians are so great?
S28E03_463#Watch as your beloved hooligans
S28E03_466#tear your innocent father limb from limb
S28E03_468#with just the slightest provocation.
S28E03_471#Listen up,
S28E03_473#you clam-gargling tea-tossers!
S28E03_476#Fenway is a terrible ballpark!
S28E03_478#Dad, don't!
S28E03_480#Out of my way, ladies. You're blocking my shot.
S28E03_482#The seats at Fenway Park are too narrow,
S28E03_485#and many of them face center field!
S28E03_489#It's not charming, it's a teardown!
S28E03_492#The bobbleheads!
S28E03_493#They're tippin'!
S28E03_495#Kid, mind the cart!
S28E03_496#- The what? - The cart!
S28E03_497#The cot?
S28E03_499#Cot!
S28E03_504#No, don't struggle!
S28E03_506#It only makes them bobble harder.
S28E03_508#They keep coming. Bobblehead Steven Wright,
S28E03_511#bobblehead Aimee Mann, bobblehead Bell Biv Devoe!
S28E03_514#The vibrations are killing him!
S28E03_516#Don't worry, sweetheart, I'm a doctor.
S28E03_519#I'm also a doctor, kid.
S28E03_523#Mm, so many doctors.
S28E03_525#He's got a Pedro lodged in his airway.
S28E03_528#He'll be fine, ma'am.
S28E03_530#And because of our state's super-socialized health care,
S28E03_533#no matter how much your husband abuses his body,
S28E03_536#someone else will pay for it.
S28E03_538#What a relief for women with hot-tempered,
S28E03_541#accident-prone husbands.
S28E03_543#Oh, yeah, we got a whole surgical center
S28E03_545#for injuries from falling off icy roofs and gutters.
S28E03_553#While the doctors pull tiny Bruins helmets out of your skin,
S28E03_556#Lisa and I are going to explore The Hub on our own.
S28E03_559#Remember, this is a hate-cation.

S28E03_562#Isn't Mayor Quimby from somewhere around here?
S28E03_572#People are so fit here.
S28E03_574#Everyone looks like they're in a financial services ad.

S28E03_581#Do you vaccinate your children?
S28E03_582#Of course.
S28E03_584#But not stupid progressive.

S28E03_591#It's-it's nerds!
S28E03_593#They've got every recognized species of nerd!

S28E03_601#Oculus rifters!
S28E03_603#Yo-yo guys. Yo-yo girls!
S28E03_605#A chain mail ping pong player.
S28E03_609#So much education.
S28E03_612#If they did a Real Housewives here, it would be a total snooze.
S28E03_616#Ah, it's like heaven for people who don't believe in heaven.
S28E03_619#What the crap is this BS?
S28E03_621#What? I thought you'd want to try candlepin bowling.
S28E03_626#Hey, McCarthy, nice half-Worcester.
S28E03_629#Get bent, McDonald.
S28E03_631#A lot of wood to work with out there.
S28E03_632#Boston.
S28E03_634#They even found a way to mess up bowling.
S28E03_636#Just try it.
S28E03_639#Eh, all right.
S28E03_646#None of the usual pain in my knees, back,
S28E03_648#wrist, shoulder, neck, and chest.
S28E03_657#One pin standing.
S28E03_658#Story of my life.
S28E03_660#Whoa there, pal.
S28E03_662#Don't forget your third ball.
S28E03_663#Hold on, wait.
S28E03_664#Wait. Hold on.
S28E03_665#Wait.
S28E03_668#What?
S28E03_670#This is candlepin bowling.
S28E03_671#You get three.
S28E03_682#Three balls.
S28E03_684#I see it all so clearly now.
S28E03_687#What, Dad? What is it?
S28E03_689#This regional bowling with its one extra roll
S28E03_693#has knocked my misguided hate into the gutter.
S28E03_697#I like Boston!
S28E03_699#Dad, you and me are real father-son Southies, now.
S28E03_702#Just like Ben and Casey Affleck.
S28E03_705#Son, show me everything this town has to offer.
S28E03_734#You know, for a cake,
S28E03_736#this Boston cream pie isn't so bad.
S28E03_739#Look at them. So innocent.
S28E03_741#Not Bart, but go on.
S28E03_743#Homer,
S28E03_745#I never dared dream about living somewhere that values education, 
S28E03_748#with great health care,
S28E03_750#and everyone's outdoorsy but still pallid.
S28E03_752#If it weren't crazy,
S28E03_754#I'd say we should be raising our kids here.
S28E03_756#But no. No, no. That's crazy!
S28E03_758#Is it?
S28E03_761#But I never thought you, of all people...
S28E03_764#Honey, this could be the chance we never thought we'd get.
S28E03_767#The chance to knock down all of life's pins.
S28E03_770#Are you saying what I think you're saying?
S28E03_774#I am. Fate is offering us a third ball.
S28E03_778#Do you mean it? Are we going to move to Boston?
S28E03_781#I knew I didn't pay this month's mortgage for a reason.
S28E03_799#We did it! We really did it! We made a life change.
S28E03_802#I love these colonial quilts on the wall.
S28E03_805#Now, I can take a nap standing up.
S28E03_813#Check it out, kid.
S28E03_815#This movie's my life now.
S28E03_819#You want to rob the Harvard Coop?

S28E03_834#I got to get one of those "X" necklaces to kiss.

S28E03_844#Don't worry, baby.
S28E03_846#I have a line on a sweet safety inspector gig.
S28E03_849#Very sweet.
S28E03_862#Can I get a test on batch six?
S28E03_865#I'm finally living my dream

S28E03_878#Are you sure we have to go to school here?

S28E03_891#Here's my classroom.
S28E03_894#The teacher is Doris Kearns Goodwin.
S28E03_898#Today, we explore Lincoln's 1861 suspension of habeas corpus,

S28E03_917#How do you like them marbles?
S28E03_919#Bart, we have a place for kids like you.
S28E03_921#Bring it on.
S28E03_927#Kids singing?
S28E03_934#What the hell?
S28E03_936#Like you, these kids are gifted with exceptional energy,
S28E03_939#which they've channeled into a cappella.
S28E03_942#*I'm shipping up to Boston*

S28E03_949#I've never felt more like I fit in.
S28E03_951#People think Boston's all Southies and hooligans.
S28E03_954#But it's really teachers, Ph.D. Students,
S28E03_957#doctors, innovators, philanthropists.
S28E03_959#It's like living in a giant classroom.
S28E03_961#And every day is a new test.
S28E03_968#Theater?
S28E03_970#Colleges?
S28E03_973#Culture?
S28E03_977#Oh, Pauly,
S28E03_979#if you could have known that Boston was gonna turn out so wussy,
S28E03_982#you never would have warned anybody.
S28E03_985#Listen, my brother, and you shall see,
S28E03_988#this is a town not for you, but for me.
S28E03_994#Hey, but what about Grampa?
S28E03_996#He lives a thousand miles away.
S28E03_997#Great point.
S28E03_998#Nobody tell him where we went.
S28E03_1000#Bart, you haven't touched your clambake.
S28E03_1002#What's wrong?
S28E03_1004#This place is all P.C. Brainiacs and Subaru owners
S28E03_1006#wearing fleece vests.
S28E03_1008#It's nothing at all like The Departed.
S28E03_1010#Oh, honey, I know it's a big change.
S28E03_1013#But someday you'll understand that providing our family
S28E03_1016#with a better life...
S28E03_1018#Something I've never been able to do.
S28E03_1020#...is the most important thing in the world.

S28E03_1029#Same to you.
S28E03_1031#No one likes feeling out of place.
S28E03_1033#That's how I felt back in Springfield.

S28E03_1077#I hope it never ends.
S28E03_1079#So don't I.
S28E03_1081#You know, guys, I've picked out the perfect Boston activity
S28E03_1084#to help celebrate our move.
S28E03_1086#Ooh, a parade.
S28E03_1088#Not just any parade.
S28E03_1090#The Boston Americans?
S28E03_1094#Bonk! Bonk! Bonk!
S28E03_1097#It's a state holiday 
S28E03_1099#because the league overturned the coach's suspension
S28E03_1101#for using magnets to affect the coin toss.
S28E03_1103#Pretty cool way to celebrate our new hometown.
S28E03_1105#Right, Dad?
S28E03_1108#As a Bostonian, I definitely support my team.
S28E03_1114#Hey, Bonk! Can we get a picture?
S28E03_1116#Hell to the derrr, little bro!
S28E03_1120#Come on, Homer, put on the hat.
S28E03_1123#I can support my hometown team without putting on a hat.
S28E03_1126#Hats go on your head!
S28E03_1128#If you're gonna live in Boston, you got to wear the hat.
S28E03_1133#Okay.
S28E03_1140#You did this on purpose.
S28E03_1142#My future is at stake.
S28E03_1144#So don't is mine.
S28E03_1146#Just... a... hat.
S28E03_1149#You can do it, Homie.
S28E03_1150#Think of the candlepins.
S28E03_1152#This is our extra ball!
S28E03_1156#A... better... life.
S28E03_1167#Stupid cheaters!
S28E03_1168#You cheat,
S28E03_1170#you flip out when people say you cheat,
S28E03_1172#and everybody knows
S28E03_1174#you're nothing but a big bunch of cheaters!
S28E03_1179#You made us leave that lovely city
S28E03_1181#rather than just put on a stupid hat.
S28E03_1183#It wasn't even fitted.
S28E03_1185#I just couldn't wear the hat.
S28E03_1187#Well, I'm still mad at you.
S28E03_1189#I never even got to experience one of those Boston winters
S28E03_1192#everyone raves about.
S28E03_1194#Come on, baby, we could never escape our problems
S28E03_1196#by moving somewhere else.
S28E03_1198#Our problems are who we are, not where we are.
S28E03_1201#Well... maybe.
S28E03_1203#The traffic was pretty annoying.
S28E03_1205#Not to mention the unspoken racism.
S28E03_1208#It wasn't that unspoken.
S28E03_1211#At least someone in this family
S28E03_1213#is happy about where they came from.
S28E03_1216#Oh, don't worry, Lisa.
S28E03_1218#You'll get back to Boston someday.
S28E03_1220#What are you talking about?
S28E03_1221#I never left.
S28E03_1223#I'm in Boston now.
S28E03_1227#Welcome home, Lisa.
S28E03_1229#Class is about to start.
S28E01_120#And that's where Lard Lad used to be!
S28E01_123#Oh, looks like we better file a report
S28E01_125#with the Bureau of Missing Statues.
S28E01_127#Yeah. Be like that time that Rodin statue got stolen.
S28E01_130#What was the name of that statue again?
S28E01_132#Ah, let me think.
S28E01_133#Thinkin'.
S28E01_135#Yeah, still thinkin'.
S28E01_137#Still thinkin'.
S28E01_140#Uh, either we can fan out and search,
S28E01_142#or bunch up and riot.
S28E01_144#Oh, balderdash and poppycock. I say we do not riot.
S28E01_146#Riot!
S28E01_148#Don't!
S28E01_149#Riot!
S28E01_150#Don't!
S28E01_152#Riot!
S28E01_165#And thanks to the equal number of nonrioters,
S28E01_168#the total cost of the damage is zero dollars.
S28E01_171#Homer, were you in that riot?
S28E01_172#Marge, please.
S28E01_174#I'm a leader in this community.
S28E01_176#In response to the outcry,
S28E01_178#Lard Lad's parent company,
S28E01_180#Tianjin Mining and Smelting and Donuts,
S28E01_181#has issued the following statement:
S28E01_184#"We are rebranding Lard Lad with an updated statue."
S28E01_187#Rebranding.
S28E01_189#That just means admitting failure, Dad.
S28E01_191#Admitting failure.
S28E01_193#People of Springfield,
S28E01_195#please welcome Mr....
S28E01_197#I know I'm gonna mangle this... Lee Fong.
S28E01_200#Uh, actually, it's pronounced Robert Chan.
S28E01_204#And now, please welcome the model for the original Lard Lad,
S28E01_207#Mr. Laird Lad.
S28E01_209#A lot of crazy names today.
S28E01_213#Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Lard Lad's bold,
S28E01_216#focus-grouped, new look!
S28E01_222#That doesn't say donuts!
S28E01_224#that says management overthink!
S28E01_226#The Thinker!
S28E01_228#That statue's called The Thinker.
S28E01_230#What? What are we on now?
S28E01_231#What?
S28E01_232#People, let's give the new statue a chance.
S28E01_235#When the Eiffel Tower was first built,
S28E01_237#many said it was a steel monstrosity.
S28E01_240#It still is.
S28E01_242#Fine, but maybe this will grow on you.
S28E01_245#- Aw, this thing sucks. - I don't think so.
S28E01_248#Well, at-at-at a certain angle...
S28E01_249#it's beautiful.
S28E01_250#- We love it. - That's beautiful.
S28E01_257#You fools!
S28E01_259#You've erected a massive concave reflective surface.
S28E01_262#It will focus the sun's beam in a deadly ray.
S28E01_283#- Yeah! - Yeah!
S28E01_299#First off, I'd like to thank the good people
S28E01_302#at Tianjin Smelting and Mining and Donuts and Tarps
S28E01_306#for neutralizing our wonderful, deadly, new Lard Lad.
S28E01_309#Yeah, that's great.
S28E01_311#They'll grow back.
S28E01_314#The time for mourning and blaming our mayors has passed.
S28E01_317#We will rebuild.
S28E01_319#We will rebuild.
S28E01_321#We will rebuild.
S28E01_323#We will rebuild!
S28E01_326#We will rebuild!
S28E01_336#We will rebuild.
S28E01_338#We will rebuild.
S28E01_340#I guess there's only one man we can turn to.
S28E01_342#Supergirl?!
S28E01_348#So... you'd like me to save the town.
S28E01_351#Well, you've got gumption, I'll give you that.
S28E01_353#And such an adorable baby,
S28E01_355#it really restores my... my faith in... in the, uh...
S28E01_358#Smithers, where is the damn trapdoor button?
S28E01_361#Mr. Burns, you already trap-doored us
S28E01_364#from your upstairs office.
S28E01_365#Yes.
S28E01_366#And how was your fall?
S28E01_368#Painful? Unexpected?
S28E01_370#- Oh, yeah. - Worst I've ever had.
S28E01_371#- Oh! Really... - Really...
S28E01_372#- Pulled something. - Totally painful.
S28E01_374#Did not see it coming.
S28E01_376#Excellent.
S28E01_380#So... remind me what I was saying no to.
S28E01_383#Funding repairs to the town.
S28E01_385#But if you could do even one little project.
S28E01_388#Reducking the duck pond
S28E01_390#or fixing up the Springfield Bowl.
S28E01_392#The Springfield Bowl.
S28E01_399#Very well.
S28E01_401#I will rebuild this town on one condition.
S28E01_403#Forget it.
S28E01_405#Our desperate plea is nonnegotiable.
S28E01_407#I want to put on a variety show at the Bowl.
S28E01_410#A celebration of everything wonderful about...
S28E01_412#what's the name of this town again?
S28E01_413#Springfield, sir.
S28E01_415#Yes, I will destroy Springfield.
S28E01_417#Celebrate, sir.
S28E01_419#Fine, we will try your way first.
S28E01_423#Springfield has risen from the ashes like a phoenix.
S28E01_425#That's phoenix, the mythical bird,
S28E01_428#not Phoenix, the cultureless, Mars-scape of the Southwest.
S28E01_431#Our unlikely angel,
S28E01_433#the devil himself, C. Montgomery Burns.
S28E01_435#Thank you, Kent.
S28E01_439#And don't forget the open auditions
S28E01_441#for my Springfield Follies.
S28E01_443#This year women may audition, too,
S28E01_444#with permission of husband,
S28E01_446#father and pastor in writing.
S28E01_449#Next.
S28E01_460#*Un bel di, vedremo*
S28E01_467#*Levarsi un fil di fumo*
S28E01_471#Puccini's a little well-trod, don't you think?
S28E01_475#This isn't right.
S28E01_477#This isn't how it was at all.
S28E01_479#I remember that night so vividly.
S28E01_485#Monty, time to go on stage.
S28E01_486#Yes, Mama.
S28E01_488#Your little butterscotch drop won't let you down.
S28E01_491#Aw, who's candy?
S28E01_492#You's candy.
S28E01_494#Oh, I'm gonna lick you, my sweet little lolly.
S28E01_496#Who likes Mommy's licks?
S28E01_498#Monty likes Mommy's licks.
S28E01_499#Lickity, lickity, lick.
S28E01_506#But the butterscotch soon turned to bitter squelch.
S28E01_509#I want everything just as it was back then.
S28E01_511#The stage filled with children
S28E01_512#like those from 1913.
S28E01_514#High-spirited, snaggletoothed,
S28E01_516#and willing to work 18 hours a day.
S28E01_517#Attention.
S28E01_520#An old man is prowling the school, looking for young children.
S28E01_522#Please, perform for him.
S28E01_525#Watch me make this nerd disappear.
S28E01_529#Also...
S28E01_531#Excellent villain.
S28E01_532#And my cast is complete.
S28E01_534#I'll just save the list and...
S28E01_539#Samson himself could not pry open these jaws.
S28E01_541#Can I help you, sir?
S28E01_543#Oh, women aren't meant for clasp opening.
S28E01_548#Young lady, if there's one thing I know about show business,
S28E01_551#it's that there are a lot of clipboards.
S28E01_553#How would you like to be my assistant director?
S28E01_557#And I'll be perfectly positioned
S28E01_559#to find out exactly what Mr. Burns is really up to.
S28E01_561#I'm in.
S28E01_563#And if you need another act,
S28E01_565#I also play this.
S28E01_566#There's no room in my show
S28E01_568#for Adolphe Sax's vile-sounding o-phone.
S28E01_571#Do you ever say anything in a simple way?
S28E01_572#Shut up.
S28E01_574#Well, that was clear.
S28E01_577#Hey, Homer, are you sure we haven't let the plant
S28E01_579#slip with Mr. Burns gone?
S28E01_581#Smitty, as a wise, old man once said,
S28E01_583#"Out with the old...
S28E01_585#and in with the brew."
S28E01_618#That's enough.
S28E01_620#But I haven't started my act.
S28E01_622#Muntz, what have you got?
S28E01_623#A rabbit in a bag.
S28E01_625#Ooh, a promising magic trick.
S28E01_627#No, it's my lunch.
S28E01_629#Bah! You're all incompetent.
S28E01_631#I won't go through this a second time.
S28E01_632#Second time?
S28E01_634#Is there something you're not telling us?
S28E01_635#A vast amount.
S28E01_637#And what part of "What I've never told you"
S28E01_639#Don't you understand?
S28E01_649#Mother, what is that sound they're making?
S28E01_650#Well, it's called laughter.
S28E01_652#You're a laughingstock, Charles.
S28E01_654#Oh, oh, it's awful.
S28E01_657#This show isn't good enough.
S28E01_659#No show could be good enough.
S28E01_661#It's not?
S28E01_670#What are you doing?
S28E01_672#Getting ready for Monday.
S28E01_675#I'm gonna fill a Super Soaker full of lemonade,
S28E01_677#Carl's gonna fill one with iced tea,
S28E01_679#and we're gonna Arnold Palmer Lenny
S28E01_681#when he walks in.
S28E01_686#Arnold Palmer Lenny.
S28E01_688#You're going to Arnold Palmer Lenny.
S28E01_692#Yeah, you see, Arnold Palmer was a golfer
S28E01_695#and he made up this drink
S28E01_697#where it's not a full glass of lemonade
S28E01_700#or a full glass of iced tea.
S28E01_702#Instead...
S28E01_704#Homie, I'm worried about all this silliness at work.
S28E01_707#You're the safety inspector.
S28E01_709#I'm a safety inspector.
S28E01_711#Not the.
S28E01_712#I've never seen another.
S28E01_714#What... wait, one safety inspector?
S28E01_716#For the whole nuclear plant?
S28E01_718#That's insane.
S28E01_721#Put everything in the car and get out of town.
S28E01_723#I'll find you, if there are still roads!
S28E01_725#Sweetie, sweetie,
S28E01_727#all you've got to do is be responsible.
S28E01_729#Your friends consider you the leader
S28E01_731#because you're a little taller.
S28E01_736#With above-average height comes above-average responsibility.
S28E01_739#Marge, thank you for setting me straight.
S28E01_741#You're welcome.
S28E01_744#Okay, I want to open this show
S28E01_746#with someone being shot into a cannon.
S28E01_750#You're joking, right?
S28E01_753#Well, because, see, that's impossible.
S28E01_762#Everyone, little miss nitpick hates the show,
S28E01_764#so I'm shutting it down.
S28E01_768#This was an act.
S28E01_769#Now it's just bullying.
S28E01_779#Thanks a lot, Lisa.
S28E01_781#We were getting out of school for this.
S28E01_787#Well if isn't the little girl that made a billionaire cry.
S28E01_789#May I please speak with Mr. Burns?
S28E01_791#No, he's very busy.
S28E01_795#Won't you please come back and do the show?
S28E01_797#Shan't.
S28E01_803#Oh, that bell has quite the recoil.
S28E01_806#Oh, what is bothering him?
S28E01_808#And what were those weird lines around his eyes?
S28E01_810#I know.
S28E01_812#It's such a tragedy on that beautiful face.
S28E01_815#Come here.
S28E01_817#Well, there's only one explanation for those lines, Lisa.
S28E01_820#He's been watching something on the Mutoscope.
S28E01_825#So, if I play this,
S28E01_827#I'll know the answer.
S28E01_829#It, uh, costs a nickel.
S28E01_854#So this is what made Mr. Burns the monster he is.
S28E01_858#Within days
S28E01_860#half of America was cranking to my bottom.
S28E01_863#I think you're trying to make up for what happened to you then
S28E01_865#by putting on a perfect Bowl show now.
S28E01_868#Spare me your amateur psychology.
S28E01_870#"Ooh, I saw my father decapitated by a grain harvester
S28E01_873#"And now I can't enjoy wheat. Boohoo."
S28E01_877#Mr. Burns, I want you to listen to that crowd.
S28E01_885#Do you really want to let those happy, joyous people win?
S28E01_894#Smithers, locate my dickey.
S28E01_895#We've got a show to do.
S28E01_897#*I was gonna clean my room*
S28E01_899#*Until I got high*
S28E01_902#*I was gonna get up and find the broom*
S28E01_904#*But then...*
S28E01_906#Springfield Nuclear.
S28E01_908#Yes, yes, sir, I'll alert the workers...
S28E01_910#that the pizzas are here!
S28E01_914#Oh, yeah, here he comes.
S28E01_916#The life of this party!
S28E01_919#Who wants to get back to work?
S28E01_921#What?
S28E01_924#We are a public trust.
S28E01_926#We bring power to people's homes.
S28E01_930#Lightbulbs, toasters, and that's all I can think of.
S28E01_933#Now let's buckle down!
S28E01_937#Okay, Homer, just let us get our microwave popcorn
S28E01_939#out of the core.
S28E01_940#You're only supposed to do that
S28E01_942#when we're watching a movie in the core.
S28E01_970#Thank you, thank you.
S28E01_971#Well, that's the easiest time
S28E01_973#anyone's had parking at the Springfield Bowl.
S28E01_976#Don't you laugh at me!
S28E01_979#Now, enjoy the show.
S28E01_982#God always liked you best.
S28E01_984#No, God loves everyone equally.
S28E01_987#That's wonderful news.
S28E01_990#Enough of your tomfoolery, Todd.
S28E01_992#Let's sing.
S28E01_994#*Michael, row your boat ashore*
S28E01_998#*Hallelujah*
S28E01_1001#*Michael, row your boat ashore*
S28E01_1004#*Hallelu...*
S28E01_1008#Say, Sockie, who was that lady I saw you with last night?
S28E01_1011#That was no lady.
S28E01_1013#That was your mother.
S28E01_1015#Oh, she'll date anyone.
S28E01_1017#Why won't she give me a stable home?
S28E01_1033#Um, this is just a simple twins trick.
S28E01_1035#They pulled the other twin out of the tank
S28E01_1037#behind the curtain.
S28E01_1046#Wait, that wasn't part of the show.
S28E01_1049#No. No, it's not fair!
S28E01_1051#I was good!
S28E01_1052#Arnold.
S28E01_1053#Palmer!
S28E01_1057#Fantastic.
S28E01_1059#What a finale, eh, Mr. Burns?
S28E01_1061#Childhood trauma cured, huh, huh?
S28E01_1064#That wasn't the finale.
S28E01_1071#Maestro, "Golden Slippers," if you please.
S28E01_1073#Ooh, boy.
S28E01_1080#We can't let him make a fool of himself again.
S28E01_1083#No, no, Mr. Burns needs to do this.
S28E01_1089#*Oh, dem golden slippers*
S28E01_1091#*Oh, dem gold...*
S28E01_1094#The burn.
S28E01_1096#Mr. Burns can't take the impact of that many photons.
S28E01_1099#Those light-shining fools!
S28E01_1108#Oh, for a murder of crows
S28E01_1111#to pluck out mine eyes!
S28E01_1112#You.
S28E01_1113#This show was your fault.
S28E01_1115#Well, you'd better know this, mister.
S28E01_1117#This town has my back.
S28E01_1118#And... hey.
S28E01_1120#Where did they go?
S28E01_1122#How did 15,000 people leave so fast?
S28E01_1126#Want to see me do a cartwheel?
S28E01_1132#Always had trouble with those.
S28E01_1135#Oh, I can't stay mad at you.
S28E01_1137#At my age, I can't stay anything at anybody.
S28E01_1139#Oh, and you know what?
S28E01_1141#The laughter in my head is gone.
S28E01_1143#Go ahead, blow your German kazoo.
S28E01_1145#Yes, sir!
S28E01_1150#Smithers, tap my foot for me.
S28E01_1152#With impatience.
S28E01_1154#Now, lift my arm so I can check my watch.
S28E01_1156#Oh, you really should start doing
S28E01_1157#some of these things yourself.
S28E01_1163#Dad, why do Simpsons always fail?
S28E01_1166#Oh, sweetie pie,
S28E01_1168#it's a terrible curse that goes back centuries.
S28E01_1172#No, no!
S28E01_1173#Don't answer that.
S28E01_1175#We just need a place to stay for the night.
S28E01_1178#Oh, shouldn't we help them?
S28E01_1180#Hey, in Zero BC, you can't trust anybody.
S28E01_1183#Curse them, Mary!
S28E01_1185#You curse them, my water just broke!
S28E01_1186#Please?
S28E01_1193#You're telling me that really happened?
S28E01_1195#They looked just like us, didn't they?
S28E01_1209#Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's all, folks!
S28E02_126#That is my family...people who love me.
S28E02_129#Yes, you're right.
S28E02_131#I should consider encasing people in plastic.
S28E02_133#Then I could always see the look of fear in their faces.
S28E02_136#Yeah, we're finished here. Get out.
S28E02_138#May I remind you I'm paying you five dollars an hour?
S28E02_140#Oi! Why did I lock in at that rate?
S28E02_148#What?
S28E02_153#Hmm. No pulse. Oh, wait, that's me.
S28E02_158#Dead. So sad. He was a true friend.
S28E02_162#Excellent.
S28E02_167#I can't believe Dr. Nussbaum's dead.
S28E02_170#Um, we've had a lot of therapists.
S28E02_173#Which one was he again?
S28E02_175#He was the one who helped us communicate.
S28E02_178#- You never listen to a word I say! - I have to listen all day at work.
S28E02_181#- You're not listening now. - I'm listened out!
S28E02_182#- What? "Listened out." - Not listening...
S28E02_184#- What does that even mean? - Not listening,  
S28E02_186#Let's hear what the children have to say.
S28E02_188#- I'm gonna wet the bed to get their attention. - Not listening...
S28E02_190#You're the one sleeping in it.
S28E02_192#I didn't say I'd wet my bed.
S28E02_194#Please, Marge! Do we have to burden
S28E02_196#Dr. Nussbaum with our problems?
S28E02_198#- Maggie talk! - The man has problems of his own!
S28E02_200#Maggie talk!
S28E02_204#No one listen? Maggie never talk again.
S28E02_208#- That's not what happened. - That's exactly what happened.
S28E02_210#I believe I remember what happened, Marge. - How could you remember?
S28E02_213#You were looking at your phone half the time.
S28E02_215#When you have four bar Wi-Fi, you use it!
S28E02_218#Oh, look. It's the ugly people from the cube.
S28E02_220#Uh, if we can begin.
S28E02_222#Oh, of course.
S28E02_224#Oh, this man meant a great deal to me.
S28E02_226#And helping out with the cost of this service 
S28E02_227#was the least I could do.
S28E02_228#Very sweet.
S28E02_229#Smithers?
S28E02_234#For shame!
S28E02_243#Stoned at a funeral.
S28E02_245#Ooh, wow! Where's the funeral?
S28E02_249#Oh! Just what I wanted.
S28E02_251#Just get me home quickly.
S28E02_259#And this year's Nobel Prize for Physics goes to...
S28E02_262#Professor John Frink.
S28E02_271#Ah, thank you, Queen Sonya, and all the people at HBO...
S28E02_274#the, uh, Higgs Boson Observatory.
S28E02_276#You'll see there.
S28E02_278#Oi! Oiven!
S28E02_280#I-I didn't mean to hit him, sir.
S28E02_282#Well, how could a man in his right mind
S28E02_284#miss a car heading right towards him?
S28E02_286#Idiot!
S28E02_288#I think it's this headpiece he's wearing, sir.
S28E02_291#If I may ask, what makes this device so enchanting
S28E02_294#that you ignore the real world?
S28E02_296#Is there a milkmaid skipping rope?
S28E02_302#Oi! Gloivick!
S28E02_304#The Oculus Frink... or Froculus...
S28E02_308#provides you with a complete virtual reality experience.
S28E02_311#Letting you live in a world of your dreams.
S28E02_319#To adjust the focus, turn the dial on the side.
S28E02_325#Now for the after-party!
S28E02_335#I must have it!
S28E02_337#Oh, uh, can you drop me off first?
S28E02_354#Not bad. Next?
S28E02_356#This is still a new technology, sir.
S28E02_358#At the moment, it's really just lots of pornography,
S28E02_361#a roller coaster, pornography, pornography,
S28E02_363#Burger King ad, pornography,
S28E02_364#and... and this one.
S28E02_376#Dragon porn.
S28E02_381#Oh, flame on, baby.
S28E02_382#Flame on!
S28E02_383#Hot! Hot!
S28E02_385#Don't tell my wife, okay?
S28E02_386#Oh, sorry, sir.
S28E02_388#This one is also pornography.
S28E02_389#Oh, so boring.
S28E02_392#Trim those nails, Smithers.
S28E02_394#Uh, sir, if I might suggest,
S28E02_396#the last thing your therapist said was,
S28E02_398#"You need a family."
S28E02_400#I don't need anyone.
S28E02_402#We could program a virtual family for you, sir.
S28E02_406#A virtual family. Yes.
S28E02_407#Meanwhile, let me see the one again
S28E02_409#where I shoot the beloved lion in Africa.
S28E02_411#That was reality, sir.
S28E02_413#I've lived quite the life.
S28E02_415#Quite the life.
S28E02_420#We only need three children, thanks.
S28E02_422#Oh, what kind of coal mine you runnin'?
S28E02_426#You, wife, look at me lovingly,
S28E02_429#as if I'm your husband.
S28E02_431#Can you ask for a look of indifference?
S28E02_433#I think she can do that.
S28E02_435#Luann, pretend it's my birthday.
S28E02_437#Next.
S28E02_439#You promised me a job, Dad!
S28E02_441#I was gonna buy a fat Barbie.
S28E02_443#It's Curvy Barbie.
S28E02_445#And that would mean you have to buy all new clothes.
S28E02_449#This thing says all families in the plant
S28E02_451#are required to try out.
S28E02_452#So far, so good.
S28E02_454#Two-and-a-half children, wife with current hairstyle.
S28E02_456#You're all hired.
S28E02_458#Except you, fatso. We don't need a father.
S28E02_460#I'll be the rooster in this henhouse.
S28E02_462#That is so disappointing.
S28E02_464#I've always wanted to work for Mr. Burns.
S28E02_470#Okay, family scene.
S28E02_472#And... action.
S28E02_486#This isn't a word I use lightly, but... excellent.
S28E02_489#Oh, Smithers, one favor:
S28E02_491#make the children look like they're mine.
S28E02_495#No, no, no! It's too beautiful.
S28E02_498#Like a Supreme Court full of Scalias.
S28E02_499#Switch to something else.
S28E02_507#That's good.
S28E02_508#What's the matter, Homer?
S28E02_510#Last night, Marge and the kids
S28E02_512#didn't get home till 11:00 at night.
S28E02_514#When I came back from Moe's at 11:05,
S28E02_516#they were still taking off their coats!
S28E02_519#I hear old man Burns is just living in a fantasy world now.
S28E02_521#En garde!
S28E02_523#Must be nice.
S28E02_525#Hey, there he is. Wonder what he's watching now.
S28E02_527#Home movies.
S28E02_531#*Happy birthday, dear Burnsie*
S28E02_536#*Happy birthday to you*
S28E02_540#*And maybe more*
S28E02_542#Thank you, thank you.
S28E02_544#Now, your mother's going to take me upstairs
S28E02_546#to give me... her present.
S28E02_553#Oh, Smithers, could you remove the ankle bar?
S28E02_556#More. More. More.
S28E02_562#That was wonderful.
S28E02_564#I'm picking up your ten-year options.
S28E02_566#Ten years?!
S28E02_568#Oh, now, now, no discussion.
S28E02_570#We're a family now.
S28E02_573#What is that? A river otter?
S28E02_580#We're not coming home, Homie.
S28E02_582#What? What do I do without you here?
S28E02_585#You can do what you did with me there: 
S28E02_587#go to Moe's.
S28E02_588#Aw, it's not the same
S28E02_590#if I'm not trying to avoid some unpleasant chore.
S28E02_593#Oh. You could clean out the attic.
S28E02_594#Going to Moe's!
S28E02_597#Eh, no one to go home to, huh?
S28E02_599#Yeah, take it from me, that's rough.
S28E02_600#Yeah.
S28E02_602#Heading back to an empty house.
S28E02_604#No one there to tell you what to do,
S28E02_605#no kids fighting all the time.
S28E02_607#Wait a minute.
S28E02_609#I can eat dinner in any room of the house!
S28E02_611#And not the scary ones like the basement and Bart's bedroom.
S28E02_614#And I can drink at home!
S28E02_616#Whoa, whoa! You're twisting my words there.
S28E02_618#That would be cheaper! And I wouldn't have to drive!
S28E02_620#And you are kind of mean.
S28E02_622#No one calls me mean.
S28E02_626#Moe, you're proving my point.
S28E02_628#Here we are talking, and you pull a shotgun on me.
S28E02_630#But there's never any bullets in this. Watch.
S28E02_634#Ha! Good gag, huh?
S28E02_694#Mmm, does that turn you on?
S28E02_696#Oh, yes. That's hot.
S28E02_700#The perfect temperature.
S28E02_706#Ah, Snoopy knew what he was doing, all right.
S28E02_708#How you doing?
S28E02_711#Don't worry, I've seen you naked plenty of times.
S28E02_714#I live in the house behind yours.
S28E02_716#I don't think my wife would like this.
S28E02_718#Hey, I got a boyfriend, 
S28E02_720#and you're not my type.
S28E02_721#Could you both keep it down?
S28E02_722#I'm trying to count pennies.
S28E02_725#Stupid Flanders.
S28E02_727#Oh! You made me lose count.
S28E02_731#Homer, it looks like you're out of beer, pal.
S28E02_736#Wow, can a man just be friends with a woman?
S28E02_738#Here are some pretzels.
S28E02_740#Yes, he can!
S28E02_746#Aw, don't worry. I'll fix that.
S28E02_749#Have one. I'm celebrating.
S28E02_751#My boyfriend proposed.
S28E02_754#Wow! You'll get to enjoy the most magical part of married life: 
S28E02_757#the beginning.
S28E02_761#So, uh, where's the lucky guy?
S28E02_763#Gone for the weekend.
S28E02_764#He's an airline pilot.
S28E02_766#Maybe he and I can go out for beers - before a flight. 
S28E02_769#Where's your wife?
S28E02_771#Uh, she's staying at this billionaire's house,
S28E02_774#working as a virtual reality actress.
S28E02_775#You know, the usual.
S28E02_777#Oh, Homer?
S28E02_779#Something's going on with Homer.
S28E02_781#My spousal sense is tingling.
S28E02_783#Mom, you blew the take!
S28E02_785#Okay, that's it. I'll direct.
S28E02_787#And I'll show you how a pro does it.
S28E02_789#You, daughter character, say you love me.
S28E02_790#I love you.
S28E02_791#Like you mean it.
S28E02_793#I really love you.
S28E02_794#Once more, with feeling.
S28E02_798#I... really... love... you.
S28E02_803#This girl has no chops whatsoever.
S28E02_805#The existence of my chops
S28E02_807#is not for the likes of you to ascertain, my good sir.
S28E02_811#Would you like some eggs with that ham?
S28E02_819#Looks like the old make-out king's got a new queen, huh?
S28E02_822#Guys, we're just friends.
S28E02_824#It's purely catatonic.
S28E02_825#"Platonic."
S28E02_827#That means she's into me, but I'm keeping it cool.
S28E02_830#I like you, but that's not what it means.
S28E02_833#Sure, right.
S28E02_836#Here you go, the antipasto, to share.
S28E02_841#Would you fellas like to join us?
S28E02_845#When did salad get so awful?
S28E02_848#Kale ruined everything.
S28E02_851#You're just like a guy.
S28E02_853#You're funny, you like to eat crap.
S28E02_855#If I may get personal,
S28E02_857#- what's your bowling average? - 212.
S28E02_860#Oh, my God, you're my best friend!
S28E02_862#And that's all. Just friends.
S28E02_864#Eh, we shall see.
S28E02_867#There is one test for a-romance that never fails.
S28E02_870#Enjoy it.
S28E02_877#That is not a-love!
S28E02_880#This is the best... we're friends,
S28E02_882#no one has any reason to get upset,
S28E02_883#and no one gets hurt.
S28E02_885#To no one getting hurt.
S28E02_887#Smash-cut to Marge!
S28E02_889#"Look, Monty, our daughter, the president,
S28E02_891#is delivering her speech."
S28E02_893#Excuse me, do I ever get a joke?
S28E02_895#Keep rolling.
S28E02_898#"Mr. Vice President, Madam Speaker, Chinese Overlords,
S28E02_902#years ago, our forefathers, and foremothers..."
S28E02_905#Stick to the script!
S28E02_907#Oh, you try to give direction to a bunch of land apes
S28E02_909#who aren't worth the ping-pong balls
S28E02_912#stuck to their untalented asses!
S28E02_914#Idiots! Mountebanks!

S28E02_919#Saint Francis himself would vomit with rage!
S28E02_923#Okay, you heard him, people.
S28E02_925#That was great, just a little more energy.
S28E02_927#Sir, I know you're getting frustrated,
S28E02_929#so we recorded some future scenarios.
S28E02_931#Yes, let's see what life will be like when I'm old.
S28E02_934#I'm going to build homes for the homeless
S28E02_937#with my boyfriend Sean,
S28E02_939#then it's off to Vassar in the fall.
S28E02_941#Irish boyfriend? Helping the homeless?
S28E02_944#Well, every family has one black sheep.
S28E02_945#Let's move on.
S28E02_947#How did this happen?
S28E02_950#Don't you take that tone with me.
S28E02_953#A Harvard man?
S28E02_955#I was warned there'd be nausea.
S28E02_957#I don't need them. My life is perfect.
S28E02_962#My life is perfect.
S28E02_965#49, 50. My life is perfect!
S28E02_968#Have you seen my Canadian penny?
S28E02_971#Oh, darn it, darn it, darn it!
S28E02_974#Everyone out! You're all fired!
S28E02_977#Having a family is the most meaningless experience
S28E02_978#I could imagine.
S28E02_980#Try acting.
S28E02_982#Come on, kids.
S28E02_983#I'm taking my bathrobe.
S28E02_985#There's a dye pack stitched in.
S28E02_988#Joke's on you. I like this better.
S28E02_990#Oh, go ahead, take your robe.
S28E02_991#But you'll never work in
S28E02_993#single-viewer virtual reality family melodrama again.
S28E02_997#Did you see the guitar lessons sign on the telephone pole?
S28E02_1000#I took a tab.
S28E02_1002#No, I'm not gonna take the lessons,
S28E02_1004#I just needed to blow my nose.
S28E02_1006#Ooh, my family's here. Gotta go.
S28E02_1008#Hey, guys! It's good to see you.
S28E02_1010#Hmm. Good to see you. Who were you talking to?
S28E02_1013#My friend Julia.
S28E02_1015#- Julia? Like a girl? - She's not a girl.
S28E02_1018#She's three years younger than your mother.
S28E02_1021#Now, Marge, it's cool.
S28E02_1023#All we do is share our deepest thoughts and feelings.
S28E02_1027#Kids, could you leave the room, please?
S28E02_1030#Faster!
S28E02_1032#Geronimo!
S28E02_1036#Marge, it's nothing. She's just my new best friend.
S28E02_1042#What the... Why... Why are you mad at those eggs?!
S28E02_1044#They didn't do anything!
S28E02_1047#Homer Simpson!
S28E02_1050#After all I've put up with for all these years,
S28E02_1054#if I'm not your best friend, what is this marriage about?!
S28E02_1057#Okay, okay, you're my best friend.
S28E02_1059#She's just somebody I call when I'm mad at you.
S28E02_1063#I mean, I'm never mad at you.
S28E02_1064#Well, sometimes I'm mad at you.
S28E02_1066#A little bit! But I shouldn't call her.
S28E02_1069#I should just drink it off at Moe's.
S28E02_1071#You'll never hear the name Julia again.
S28E02_1074#Hi, I'm Julia.
S28E02_1076#I just wanted to introduce myself 
S28E02_1078#and tell you you've got a great husband.
S28E02_1081#I've got a nice bicycle, too, but I keep a lock on it.
S28E02_1085#I have no interest in... riding your bike.
S28E02_1088#But I want you to know that your bike loves you
S28E02_1091#as truly as a bike can.
S28E02_1093#And, Marge, I love you as much as that bike.
S28E02_1097#- You are the bike. - Wha...?!
S28E02_1103#I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
S28E02_1105#Apparently, you didn't do anything wrong.
S28E02_1108#But I'm not wrong for getting mad at you either.
S28E02_1111#Marge, Julia taught me lots of stuff that could help us.
S28E02_1114#For example, I realize that when you see me
S28E02_1115#doing something stupid 
S28E02_1117#and you don't say anything about it, you know,
S28E02_1120#and you're just being nice.
S28E02_1123#- That's true. - And when something's bothering you,
S28E02_1126#sometimes I should just say,
S28E02_1129#"I understand," instead of trying to fix it.
S28E02_1132#Because all you really need is someone to know what you're feeling.
S28E02_1136#That is really, really lovely.
S28E02_1142#I have to confess, I did see him naked on the roof.
S28E02_1145#I did, too, and I was at 10,000 feet.
S28E02_1148#Now for the final fantasy.
S28E02_1154#Oh, my love, my love,
S28E02_1157#losing you so young, so beautiful.
S28E02_1160#Still no jokes.
S28E02_1165#I love you, and how.
S28E02_1169#You're too good for heaven, man.
S28E02_1172#Excellent.
S28E02_1181#Welcome, Monty.
S28E02_1183#I'd like to take a selfie with you.
S28E02_1188#All right, but just one.
S28E02_1190#Hmm, it's not plugged in.
S28E03_61#The only reason Boston wins is because they cheat!
S28E03_64#Listening in on our teams' headsets, fattening our cheerleaders.
S28E03_66#You know, for three games last year,
S28E03_68#Boston used a volleyball painted brown.
S28E03_71#That was never proven, you Springfield screw-job.
S28E03_74#Boston fans.
S28E03_76#In town for the Dennis Lehane book tour.
S28E03_79#Go kiss a Kennedy, you rule-breaking cranberry squeezers!
S28E03_81#We don't cheat.
S28E03_84#We won 12 division titles in ten years, fair and square.
S28E03_88#You dorks are just jealous of all our championship rings.
S28E03_93#You're the one who's jealous.
S28E03_95#I only wish I could be as jealous as you.
S28E03_97#Geez, Jay, this place has got more knobs than a hardware store.
S28E03_100#I hate this town.
S28E03_102#So don't I. Friggin' doorknobs.
S28E03_105#Automatic.
S28E03_110#It's fourth and long, the Americans' last chance for a miracle.
S28E03_113#Come on, Springfield, put it away!
S28E03_115#We're gonna win one. We're finally gonna win one!
S28E03_117#The QB handsomely takes the snap,
S28E03_119#sexily steps back to pass,
S28E03_121#and with God-given good looks, fires it downfield!
S28E03_124#But there's no one there to receive it!
S28E03_125#Nice pass.
S28E03_127#What a first-ballot hall-of-fame loser.
S28E03_131#But the ball is caught by the Americans' mascot, Flappy the Flag!
S28E03_134#Flappy running unopposed into the end zone
S28E03_136#for a surely illegal touchdown.
S28E03_138#Throwing to the mascot?
S28E03_141#After further review, Flappy the Flag is listed
S28E03_145#on the Americans' 53-man roster and reported eligible.
S28E03_148#The result of the play is a touchdown.
S28E03_151#Once again, the Americans found a way to win.
S28E03_153#Oh, that'll put a smile on Coach Bonderchuck's face.
S28E03_159#Oh, not again!
S28E03_161#They cheated! You cheated!
S28E03_163#Did not. You got to cover the mascot.
S28E03_165#Use your noggin. Play smart.
S28E03_167#Flappy's on the roster.
S28E03_169#On the roster!
S28E03_172#- On the roster! - On the roster!
S28E03_175#On the roster, my butt.
S28E03_177#Once again, those Boston cheaters 
S28E03_179#think the rules don't apply to them.
S28E03_181#And they're so smug about winning.
S28E03_183#If I ever won anything, I wouldn't be smug about it.
S28E03_186#I'd be class all the way,
S28E03_188#like Mark Harmon... pure American elegance.
S28E03_192#I tell ya, the next Boston fan I see, I'm just gonna lose it.
S28E03_195#Lose it so hard.
S28E03_197#And... What the...
S28E03_199#What is... How could...
S28E03_201#That hat! Your head!
S28E03_203#That team.
S28E03_205#My son!
S28E03_207#Hey, Dad, caught the game last night.
S28E03_209#Tough loss for your guys.
S28E03_210#Guess we just wanted it more.
S28E03_212#Oh, am I in the right house?
S28E03_214#Because no one in my house
S28E03_217#would ever be caught dead wearing Boston Americans gear.
S28E03_220#Dead!
S28E03_222#I feel ya, Homer.
S28E03_223#Sucks to be a loser.
S28E03_226#Unlike the six-time Mega-Bowl champion Boston Americans.
S28E03_230#Ring, ring, ring.
S28E03_232#Give me that hat.
S28E03_240#Ol¨¦!
S28E03_244#Your father never could resist an "Ol¨¦."
S28E03_246#Eh, he'll run out of steam soon.
S28E03_255#Get in.
S28E03_259#Look around, son.
S28E03_261#This is your hometown.
S28E03_263#And the Springfield Atoms are your hometown team...
S28E03_266#Since 2003, when we stole them
S28E03_268#in the middle of the night from Portland.
S28E03_270#What kind of life can you have here 
S28E03_272#as a Boston fan?
S28E03_273#See?
S28E03_276#Why are you wearing that Boston hat?
S28E03_277#This is Atoms country, bro!
S28E03_279#I would pluck out my own eyes 
S28E03_281#if I did not have a call-back
S28E03_284#for a Web-only Olive Garden commercial.
S28E03_290#They're just trying to hat shame me.
S28E03_291#Face it, Dad, 
S28E03_293#Boston is the Bart Simpson of cities.
S28E03_295#All those awesome Southies in The Departed,
S28E03_297#those are my people.
S28E03_299#People? The dog and the baby are your people.
S28E03_302#It all goes back to the Boston Tea Party,
S28E03_305#a prank so kick-ass it started a country.
S28E03_309#Come on, pal, what do you say?
S28E03_311#Just lose the hat, for your old man.
S28E03_316#Nope, I think I'll stick with the bad boys.
S28E03_321#Get it off before God sees.
S28E03_331#And the people from Boston are so obnoxious.
S28E03_335#They think their stupid city has the best everything:
S28E03_338#bands, comedians, chowder,
S28E03_340#their so-called cream pies, which are actually cakes.
S28E03_342#- And there's... - Why don't you let me
S28E03_344#take your mind off your problems? 
S28E03_347#And what's with Aerosmith?
S28E03_349#That's not how you spell "Arrow."
S28E03_350#The...
S28E03_364#Do your job, Homer.
S28E03_368#Bart, you're my son.
S28E03_370#There's no neck tattoo so crass,
S28E03_372#no gender reassignment too ambiguous
S28E03_374#that I would not love you.
S28E03_376#Which is why I must show you the error of your ways,
S28E03_380#even if it means dragging this family all the way to hell.
S28E03_384#A vacation to Boston?
S28E03_388#No, not a vay-cation, a hate-cation!
S28E03_391#Where you experience the worst a place has to offer, 
S28E03_394#and then say, "Told ya!"
S28E03_396#Hate-watching, hate-voting
S28E03_397#and now a hate-cation?
S28E03_399#Why can't everyone just enjoy things they like?
S28E03_402#Because things you like
S28E03_404#don't fill you with delicious, delicious rage.
S28E03_406#Hmm, I'm gonna love this trip.
S28E03_408#I'm gonna love it right in your face.
S28E03_410#That's it, build it up in your head.
S28E03_413#High hopes just make the hate-cation stronger.
S28E03_416#You're crazy. Boston can't be that bad.
S28E03_424#I've never loved hating anything so much!
S28E03_427#Move your garbage car!
S28E03_429#I got to get to the packy before the B's drop puck!
S28E03_433#Told ya!
S28E03_439#See, boy?
S28E03_441#Notice how Bostonians aren't exactly ugly,
S28E03_443#but they're not sexy either.
S28E03_446#Homer, your negative attitude is ruining this hate-cation.
S28E03_449#So, what to hate first? The Freedom Trail?
S28E03_452#The touch tank at the New England Aquarium?
S28E03_454#Ooh, that could blow.
S28E03_455#I want to go to Southie.
S28E03_458#That part of town has the towniest townies of any town.
S28E03_461#You think your Bostonians are so great?
S28E03_463#Watch as your beloved hooligans
S28E03_466#tear your innocent father limb from limb
S28E03_468#with just the slightest provocation.
S28E03_471#Listen up,
S28E03_473#you clam-gargling tea-tossers!
S28E03_476#Fenway is a terrible ballpark!
S28E03_478#Dad, don't!
S28E03_480#Out of my way, ladies. You're blocking my shot.
S28E03_482#The seats at Fenway Park are too narrow,
S28E03_485#and many of them face center field!
S28E03_489#It's not charming, it's a teardown!
S28E03_492#The bobbleheads!
S28E03_493#They're tippin'!

S28E03_499#Cot!
S28E03_504#No, don't struggle!
S28E03_506#It only makes them bobble harder.
S28E03_508#They keep coming. Bobblehead Steven Wright,

S28E03_519#I'm also a doctor, kid.
S28E03_523#Mm, so many doctors.
S28E03_525#He's got a Pedro lodged in his airway.
S28E03_528#He'll be fine, ma'am.
S28E03_530#And because of our state's super-socialized health care,
S28E03_533#no matter how much your husband abuses his body,
S28E03_536#someone else will pay for it.
S28E03_538#What a relief for women with hot-tempered,
S28E03_541#accident-prone husbands.
S28E03_543#Oh, yeah, we got a whole surgical center

S28E03_581#Do you vaccinate your children?
S28E03_582#Of course.
S28E03_584#But not stupid progressive.

S28E03_609#So much education.
S28E03_612#If they did a Real Housewives here, it would be a total snooze.
S28E03_616#Ah, it's like heaven for people who don't believe in heaven.
S28E03_619#What the crap is this BS?
S28E03_621#What? I thought you'd want to try candlepin bowling.
S28E03_626#Hey, McCarthy, nice half-Worcester.
S28E03_629#Get bent, McDonald.
S28E03_631#A lot of wood to work with out there.
S28E03_632#Boston.
S28E03_634#They even found a way to mess up bowling.
S28E03_636#Just try it.
S28E03_639#Eh, all right.
S28E03_646#None of the usual pain in my knees, back,
S28E03_648#wrist, shoulder, neck, and chest.
S28E03_657#One pin standing.
S28E03_658#Story of my life.

S28E03_664#Wait. Hold on.
S28E03_665#Wait.
S28E03_668#What?
S28E03_670#This is candlepin bowling.
S28E03_671#You get three.
S28E03_682#Three balls.
S28E03_684#I see it all so clearly now.
S28E03_687#What, Dad? What is it?
S28E03_689#This regional bowling with its one extra roll
S28E03_693#has knocked my misguided hate into the gutter.
S28E03_697#I like Boston!
S28E03_699#Dad, you and me are real father-son Southies, now.
S28E03_702#Just like Ben and Casey Affleck.
S28E03_705#Son, show me everything this town has to offer.
S28E03_734#You know, for a cake,
S28E03_736#this Boston cream pie isn't so bad.
S28E03_739#Look at them. So innocent.
S28E03_741#Not Bart, but go on.
S28E03_743#Homer,
S28E03_745#I never dared dream about living somewhere that values education,

S28E03_754#I'd say we should be raising our kids here.
S28E03_756#But no. No, no. That's crazy!
S28E03_758#Is it?
S28E03_761#But I never thought you, of all people...
S28E03_764#Honey, this could be the chance we never thought we'd get.
S28E03_767#The chance to knock down all of life's pins.
S28E03_770#Are you saying what I think you're saying?
S28E03_774#I am. Fate is offering us a third ball.
S28E03_778#Do you mean it? Are we going to move to Boston?
S28E03_781#I knew I didn't pay this month's mortgage for a reason.
S28E03_799#We did it! We really did it! We made a life change.

S28E03_1086#Ooh, a parade.
S28E03_1088#Not just any parade.
S28E03_1090#The Boston Americans?
S28E03_1094#Bonk! Bonk! Bonk!
S28E03_1097#It's a state holiday 
S28E03_1099#because the league overturned the coach's suspension
S28E03_1101#for using magnets to affect the coin toss.
S28E03_1103#Pretty cool way to celebrate our new hometown.
S28E03_1105#Right, Dad?
S28E03_1108#As a Bostonian, I definitely support my team.
S28E03_1114#Hey, Bonk! Can we get a picture?
S28E03_1116#Hell to the derrr, little bro!
S28E03_1120#Come on, Homer, put on the hat.
S28E03_1123#I can support my hometown team without putting on a hat.
S28E03_1126#Hats go on your head!
S28E03_1128#If you're gonna live in Boston, you got to wear the hat.
S28E03_1133#Okay.
S28E03_1140#You did this on purpose.
S28E03_1142#My future is at stake.
S28E03_1144#So don't is mine.
S28E03_1146#Just... a... hat.
S28E03_1149#You can do it, Homie.
S28E03_1150#Think of the candlepins.
S28E03_1152#This is our extra ball!
S28E03_1156#A... better... life.
S28E03_1167#Stupid cheaters!
S28E03_1168#You cheat,
S28E03_1170#you flip out when people say you cheat,
S28E03_1172#and everybody knows
S28E03_1174#you're nothing but a big bunch of cheaters!
S28E03_1179#You made us leave that lovely city
S28E03_1181#rather than just put on a stupid hat.
S28E03_1183#It wasn't even fitted.
S28E03_1185#I just couldn't wear the hat.
S28E03_1187#Well, I'm still mad at you.
S28E03_1189#I never even got to experience one of those Boston winters
S28E03_1192#everyone raves about.
S28E03_1194#Come on, baby, we could never escape our problems
S28E03_1196#by moving somewhere else.
S28E03_1198#Our problems are who we are, not where we are.
S28E03_1201#Well... maybe.
S28E03_1203#The traffic was pretty annoying.
S28E03_1205#Not to mention the unspoken racism.
S28E03_1208#It wasn't that unspoken.
S28E03_1211#At least someone in this family
S28E03_1213#is happy about where they came from.
S28E03_1216#Oh, don't worry, Lisa.
S28E03_1218#You'll get back to Boston someday.
S28E03_1220#What are you talking about?
S28E03_1221#I never left.
S28E03_1223#I'm in Boston now.
S28E03_1227#Welcome home, Lisa.
S28E03_1229#Class is about to start.
S28E04_70#Revenge! But first we dance.
S28E04_87#Will nobody stop these people?
S28E04_100#In Hell they make you watch them all in a row.
S28E04_156#We didn't have much in Springfield,
S28E04_158#but we always had water.
S28E04_160#Then, one day, the rain stopped.
S28E04_161#then the rivers dried up,
S28E04_164#and a drought of Chicago Cubs proportions began.
S28E04_184#Attention, friends and neighbors.
S28E04_186#As you know, I possess all the remaining water.
S28E04_196#Why do we keep reelecting this guy?
S28E04_199#To take your mind off your troubles,
S28E04_201#I will sponsor a no-holds-barred battle to the death
S28E04_203#among our cutest children.
S28E04_204#Makes sense.
S28E04_206#What sickos want to see ugly kids die?
S28E04_208#One child from each neighborhood will be selected to compete
S28E04_210#as their champion.
S28E04_212#The last child standing in a pile of his fallen chums
S28E04_216#will win a day of aquatic fun at my personal reservoir.
S28E04_222#Good luck to you all.
S28E04_233#He's wastin' water like a Tucson swim-up bar
S28E04_235#while I'm bathing with a dog's tongue here!
S28E04_239#Okay, sweetie.
S28E04_241#I've hidden a bunch of weapons in your suit.
S28E04_244#Mom, I can barely move.
S28E04_249#Well, I could use a new look.
S28E04_261#You just died.
S28E04_265#Who are you?
S28E04_267#They call me Homish.
S28E04_268#I'm your coach.
S28E04_272#It's hard to believe you could coach anyone.
S28E04_275#If you don't think I can, try watching just a few
S28E04_278#of the hundreds of movies with characters like me.
S28E04_281#Also, I sober up in the middle with no difficulty
S28E04_283#just like real alcoholics.
S28E04_287#Welcome, children.
S28E04_289#The Games will begin in ten seconds!
S28E04_291#Do not step off your pedestals before...
S28E04_293#Before what?
S28E04_301#What, what? What did I miss?
S28E04_310#The only thing I want to kill is your sadness.
S28E04_313#My name is Pita, like the healthy bread.
S28E04_316#My name is also Peta,
S28E04_318#like the animal rights organization.
S28E04_327#Did someone order two dead kids?
S28E04_341#You can come out now, Homish.
S28E04_342#What about all the birds?
S28E04_343#That was me.
S28E04_359#Wait a minute, we don't have to kill each other.
S28E04_362#Now you tell me.
S28E04_363#People of Springfield!
S28E04_365#We have the power!
S28E04_368#With all our new fighting skill, we could topple Burns.
S28E04_371#Or we could do it peacefully at the ballot box.
S28E04_375#Ned, that noggin of yours is just what we need.
S28E04_384#To the reservoir!
S28E04_386#Freedom!
S28E04_389#Right in the back!
S28E04_391#Like the coward I am.
S28E04_415#We're saved!
S28E04_419#Ah, we really should have left it in the reservoir.
S28E04_422#It was all for nothing.
S28E04_423#We're doomed.
S28E04_428#Rain. Rain. We're saved.
S28E04_434#Well, it could be worse.
S28E04_440#Oh, God, me and my big mouth.
S28E04_443#I just donated the winter clothes.
S28E04_446#I'm a god in this reality.
S28E04_448#Sure, why not?
S28E04_455#11, 12, 13.
S28E04_461#Ready or not,
S28E04_462#here I...
S28E04_467#Why? Why did my best friend have to die?
S28E04_472#I mean, it's a great college essay, 
S28E04_474#but it's not worth it.
S28E04_475#So sorry you lost your best friend
S28E04_477#in such a cool tragedy, Lisa.
S28E04_480#Since you're interesting now,
S28E04_482#you can be our best friend.
S28E04_484#Really? That would be so...
S28E04_489#We now bury Sherri and Terri, 
S28E04_492#survived by their brothers, Jerry and Larry,
S28E04_495#and their father and mother, Barry and Mary.
S28E04_499#And now some light remarks by comedian Drew Carey.
S28E04_501#There was some sort of mistake.
S28E04_503#I thought I was doing a Microsoft event.
S28E04_507#Man, who'd have thought a funeral for a couple of kids
S28E04_510#would be such a downer?
S28E04_514#Everything seems big to a child, Lisa.
S28E04_517#But in a few weeks,
S28E04_518#losing three friends in two days
S28E04_520#is something you'll laugh about.
S28E04_522#And I'm here for you.
S28E04_523#Really?
S28E04_525#Think of me as your best friend.
S28E04_529#Ms. Mancuso-Gluckman!
S28E04_533#Lisa Simpson,
S28E04_535#you are the prime suspect in the murders
S28E04_537#of two normals and a twin set.
S28E04_544#Well, well, well, well, well.
S28E04_546#Well, look what we have here.
S28E04_551#This matches what we found on the lawnmower
S28E04_553#and the picture in the therapist's office.
S28E04_555#Sparkle nail polish?
S28E04_557#But I only wore that with Rachel.
S28E04_559#Who's Rachel?
S28E04_561#And tell me it's not a computer acronym
S28E04_565#like Repeating Algorithm for Calculating Hotel...
S28E04_569#Come on, Lou, help me out here.
S28E04_571#No, no, no. You got yourself into that acronym.
S28E04_573#You can, uh, get yourself out.
S28E04_576#Lou stands for lousy, obstinate, um...
S28E04_578#Uh, help me out here, Lou.
S28E04_580#I had no real friends.
S28E04_582#So I played with my imaginary friend, Rachel.
S28E04_585#We did it all together.
S28E04_587#I was maid of honor at her imaginary wedding.
S28E04_590#But then I outgrew her.
S28E04_601#And I never saw Rachel or wore this nail polish again.
S28E04_604#That's a nice story, kid, but, uh,
S28E04_606#we're keeping our eye on you.
S28E04_608#Only invisible killer I believe in is God.
S28E04_619#Well, I'm not afraid to be around you.
S28E04_623#Hello, best friend.
S28E04_629#No, no, please.
S28E04_634#Why did Mom double-wrap?
S28E04_639#How could you do that?
S28E04_641#You tell me. I came from your brain,
S28E04_644#where your darkest thoughts live.
S28E04_652#Shut up, shut up, shut up!
S28E04_655#I didn't do it.
S28E04_657#Plastic wrap doesn't lie.
S28E04_659#Except on the box, where it says "Easy tear-off."
S28E04_663#Hey, Lisa, let's gossip about boys.
S28E04_666#Isn't Milhouse so cute?
S28E04_668#Oh, of course, he suffocated.
S28E04_671#My mom was so right when she said I didn't need you anymore.
S28E04_674#Oh. Oh, I see.
S28E04_676#So, nosy old Marge was the reason
S28E04_679#you-you moved on from me.
S28E04_685#Oh, no.
S28E04_686#She'll kill Mom. What do I do?
S28E04_689#You can keep quiet and let me get you out of here.
S28E04_691#Bart! You came to save me?
S28E04_693#Actually, I deliver little bags to guys inside.
S28E04_696#Don't know what's in 'em, but they're sure glad to see me.
S28E04_698#Come on, let's go.
S28E04_699#Yo, could you please keep it down?
S28E04_701#Some of us are trying to shiv.
S28E04_704#Tell Ralphie I won't be home for dinner.
S28E04_706#Uh, tell him that dinner is the meal at the end of the day.
S28E04_710#Uh, tell him the end of the day is when the sun goes down.
S28E04_712#Tell him...
S28E04_714#Oh, thank you, thank you.
S28E04_738#God, those have so much drool.
S28E04_740#Come on, we got to save mom.
S28E04_742#Come on, imagine a motorcycle to get us out of here.
S28E04_745#My imagination isn't that powerful.
S28E04_747#You imagined a girl that's killing everyone in town.
S28E04_749#Good point.
S28E04_752#Where do I sit?
S28E04_757#Safety first.
S28E04_762#And it runs on pony smiles.
S28E04_764#Oh, man, you ruin everything.
S28E04_772#Rachel, no!
S28E04_775#Why can't a real person like me this much?
S28E04_778#I'm going to kill everyone you love.
S28E04_781#And they'll blame you because nobody else can see me.
S28E04_783#I can see you.
S28E04_786#Because I am incredibly wasted.
S28E04_793#Only...
S28E04_795#my childhood imaginary friend...
S28E04_798#can save me now.
S28E04_803#Sergeant Sausage, you came! I love you.
S28E04_806#Rachel, Rachel, you must understand
S28E04_808#the thankless role of the imaginary friend.
S28E04_811#When the child matures, you cease to exist.
S28E04_814#I don't take orders from a hot dog.
S28E04_825#No, no... Cut slits in me first!
S28E04_833#Rachel, you have to go.
S28E04_835#I can turn you into the worst thing you can imagine:
S28E04_838#your mother.
S28E04_840#No! You'll be sorry, Lisa.
S28E04_842#I'm the truest friend you've ever had.
S28E04_845#I'll have friends in college.
S28E04_847#And you'll be married to a dentist.
S28E04_850#We'll spend every vacation with my parents.
S28E04_854#You think your dad will pay for college?
S28E04_857#Now who's imagining thi...
S28E04_865#And now it's time to lay my good friend to rest.
S28E04_870#At least his life wasn't in vain.
S28E04_872#Actually, as an imaginary friend,
S28E04_874#I can never die.
S28E04_875#Get in my stomach.
S28E04_876#Okay, yes, sir.
S28E04_890#Violence never solved anything.
S28E04_892#Don't use math on us.
S28E04_897#We're gonna kill you, Simpson.
S28E04_899#And book the funeral in a huge church
S28E04_902#so it looks empty.
S28E04_906#Can I help youse gentleman?
S28E04_908#Just get your broom, old man,
S28E04_910#and get ready to sweep up some broken boy.
S28E04_913#And make it snappy.
S28E04_916#I rather wish you'd-a hadn't-a done that.
S28E04_920#You idiot, now you're trapped here with us.
S28E04_924#Idiot.
S28E04_928#Sorry. I should have used a coaster.
S28E04_938#You know we're only 13, right?
S28E04_940#Come with me.
S28E04_964#I didn't know the pool table could do that.
S28E04_966#Halloween show money.
S28E04_974#Yeah, you see, kid, it turns out the guys you thought
S28E04_976#were wastin' time in this bar
S28E04_978#were actually covert agents helpin' to save the world.
S28E04_981#So, how did things go in Prague?
S28E04_984#Oh, quite well. I canceled a few Czechs.
S28E04_987#We've had our eye on you since your father...
S28E04_989#our best man... died.
S28E04_992#They said he died jogging, but I never believed it.
S28E04_996#Smart boy. He was actually killed by our greatest nemesis.
S28E04_1000#We need you to take his place.
S28E04_1001#But I'm just a kid.
S28E04_1003#We all of us have special abilities.
S28E04_1005#All these years I've been pretending to be the idiot bartender
S28E04_1008#while actually I'm this super genius guy.
S28E04_1011#Now, do you want to avenge your father?
S28E04_1014#I'm in. Do I get any weapons?
S28E04_1016#You certainly do.
S28E04_1018#Let me introduce you to Q.
S28E04_1020#There it is. A pool cue. That's your weapon.
S28E04_1023#Now let me introduce you to your fellow agents.
S28E04_1025#Old Fashioned.
S28E04_1027#Rob Roy.
S28E04_1029#And I'm Toilet Gin. Now listen up here.
S28E04_1032#We're getting a transmission from our leader, Highball.
S28E04_1035#He does an amazing Michael Caine impression.
S28E04_1037#Good afternoon, gentlemen.
S28E04_1039#I have the most interesting development.
S28E04_1041#We have learned of a plot
S28E04_1043#to buy up all of the world's beer.
S28E04_1045#Can I help you with something, sir?
S28E04_1047#I believe that cute blonde is interested in earbuds.
S28E04_1050#Oh, boy!
S28E04_1052#Now, here is the name of our adversary.
S28E04_1054#Good luck, gentlemen.
S28E04_1057#Barney, give me what you got.

S28E04_1096#Dad? You're alive!
S28E04_1097#How'd you get that scar?
S28E04_1100#That's how.
S28E04_1102#Of course. Remoh spelled backwards is Homer.
S28E04_1105#It is? Uh, I mean, it's intentional.
S28E04_1108#Now, I suppose you're wondering
S28E04_1110#why I cornered the world beer supply.
S28E04_1114#I've created a lava machine that will force the world
S28E04_1116#to surrender to me.
S28E04_1127#Then I want all the beer to celebrate.
S28E04_1130#Well, we're gonna stop you.
S28E04_1131#Really?
S28E04_1134#To kill me, you'll have to get through an army
S28E04_1137#of jazz rock aficionados age 50 and up.
S28E04_1141#Oh, it seems like every year
S28E04_1143#my rockets get less powerful.
S28E04_1151#Attention, lovers of studio perfectionism.
S28E04_1153#I've drugged all the concessions

S28E04_1206#But, Dad, this can be a new beginning for us.
S28E04_1208#You mean you don't want to kill me?
S28E04_1210#I love you, Dad.
S28E04_1212#And violence never solved anything.

S28E05_187#It's filled with mini-colas!
S28E05_189#Wow, he looks like a giant drinking that thing.
S28E05_190#I was in line for that job, 
S28E05_192#and I lost it to someone who barely speaks English.
S28E05_195#It's humidifying.
S28E05_197#Well, then why the hell don't you do something about it?
S28E05_198#Huh? Who said that?!
S28E05_199#Me!
S28E05_202#Who are you?

S28E05_220#That's the most ambitious thing you've ever said.
S28E05_224#Guys, is there something wrong with the way I dress?
S28E05_228#No. If you're a typewriter salesman in 1953.
S28E05_231#Also, for a guy, you show way too much cleavage.

S28E05_258#Tonight we have with us a distinguished senior journalist
S28E05_261#for another installment of our pointless Internet sensation:
S28E05_263#Talking Heads Sing Talking Heads.
S28E05_265#Kent Brockman, everybody!
S28E05_268#And you may ask yourself...
S28E05_269#How do I work this?
S28E05_271#And you may ask yourself...
S28E05_273#Where is that large automobile?
S28E05_274#And you may tell yourself...
S28E05_276#Okay, that's it.
S28E05_286#Speaking of once-in-a-lifetime experiences, Kent,
S28E05_288#I understand you have a fascinating story
S28E05_289#about your time in Basra.
S28E05_291#Well, Jimmy, I was embedded with the 98th Airborne.
S28E05_294#My lullaby was the thwap-thwap-thwap
S28E05_296#of the blades of a Chinook.
S28E05_298#I was in the 98th Airborne.
S28E05_300#I don't remember him.
S28E05_302#I don't even remember what I said at the start of this sentence!
S28E05_305#Out there, everyone was equal.
S28E05_307#I was "Brock," The pilot was "Bama."
S28E05_308#Was he from Alabama?
S28E05_310#He was from America, Jimmy.
S28E05_312#To me, it was just another day at the office.
S28E05_314#Only this day, the office was a burning piece of metal
S28E05_316#where an RPG just took out the pilot.
S28E05_319#So I grabbed the joystick and guided that wounded bird
S28E05_322#down onto a container ship... which was sinking.
S28E05_325#I bailed it with my helmet and guided her home.
S28E05_330#That didn't happen, man!
S28E05_332#Oh, you Iraq War vets are always complaining.
S28E05_335#"That didn't happen."
S28E05_337#"The temperature was 125."
S28E05_340#"The U.S.O. Show was Rob Schneider."
S28E05_344#"American objectives have been, and remain, incomprehensible."
S28E05_347#Wah-wah-wah.
S28E05_351#Dinner time!
S28E05_355#No junk food!
S28E05_357#We're at the dinner tables.
S28E05_359#This is Kent Brockman with a...
S28E05_360#humble apology.
S28E05_365#You know, we in the news business like to report the story; 
S28E05_367#we don't like to be the story.
S28E05_368#That's what I said to Nelson Mandela 
S28E05_370#atop the Berlin Wall,
S28E05_371#but... No, I didn't.
S28E05_372#That's the problem!
S28E05_374#Now you're not eating.
S28E05_376#I can't eat when I'm watching the spectacle
S28E05_378#of an imploding celebrity.
S28E05_380#We have lip-quiver, people.
S28E05_382#I'm sorry to report to you that over the years,
S28E05_384#every interesting thing I've done is,
S28E05_385#in fact, a complete lie.
S28E05_387#I did not land a Chinook helicopter.
S28E05_389#I did not see bin Laden die, 
S28E05_391#or even see the movie about it.
S28E05_392#Now that I've apologized, 
S28E05_394#my station has assured me that it has full confidence...
S28E05_396#These were the last words of disgraced anchor Kent Brockman

S28E05_419#not as long as I've got a cell phone and a place to sit.
S28E05_423#Company car.
S28E05_429#Marge, I think I may have to get new clothes.
S28E05_431#At last!
S28E05_433#It's time for me to project the image
S28E05_435#of a powerful, self-reliant man.
S28E05_438#Will you take me shopping after school?
S28E05_440#Sure. And after that, maybe you could...
S28E05_442#oh, I don't know, lose a little weight?
S28E05_445#Marge, no, don't get greedy, don't get greedy.
S28E05_449#Sweetheart, I'm always happy to temporarily lose weight.
S28E05_455#So, this app is called Smothr.

S28E05_491#I shared a meal with Lisa.
S28E05_494#It's halfway to a kiss.
S28E05_496#Now I kissed Lisa.
S28E05_498#No one kissed Lisa!
S28E05_501#Hmm, I don't think candy should give me a tingling
S28E05_504#in my left arm.
S28E05_505#I'm gonna prove to you 
S28E05_507#that Krusty is a good clown with nonlethal candy.

S28E05_574#Homie?
S28E05_576#Oh, baby, you had the same idea I did.
S28E05_580#This wasn't my idea, but...
S28E05_587#They all think they're the first ones.
S28E05_592#Ready for the corner office.
S28E05_594#I feel like Mrs. Mad Men.
S28E05_597#Now let's get you rung up, lard-ass.
S28E05_599#- What did you call me? - Uh, Lord S.
S28E05_604#Well, we've got a nice- looking couple here.
S28E05_606#Walk away, Marge, just walk away.
S28E05_608#I'm holding my sharpest key.
S28E05_610#Wait, Homie. It's Kent Brockman.
S28E05_612#The man who betrayed our trust.
S28E05_614#I'm producing my own news content now.
S28E05_616#Could you spare a few sound bites

S28E05_620#Forget it. We only like newspeople we can trust.
S28E05_622#So no newspeople!
S28E05_624#Oh, well, I have bigger problems.
S28E05_627#Can't afford toothpaste, so tonight my teeth will have...

S28E05_630#Adios!
S28E05_633#Don't worry, Krusty's favorite number
S28E05_635#is how many jokes he's written.
S28E05_643#Wow! Hydroponic gardening.
S28E05_645#Organic fertilizer.
S28E05_647#Maybe I was wrong about Krusty.
S28E05_654#This candy is reeking with chemicals!
S28E05_657#Just once I'd like to be wrong.
S28E05_659#Well, from what I read in your diary, you're rarely right.
S28E05_663#We've got to get these samples analyzed.
S28E05_666#Bart, do you think we'll get out of here safely?

S28E05_689#Uh, small town in Latvia. You don't know it.
S28E05_692#Well, I'd like to hear.
S28E05_694#Why do you have to make friends with everyone?
S28E05_702#So much great work for naught.
S28E05_703#Kent, as your agent, 
S28E05_704#I promise we will find you something,
S28E05_706#or so help me, we will drop you.
S28E05_707#That's a promise.
S28E05_709#Well, could you, uh, get me on Fox News?
S28E05_712#Would you be willing to call yourself a liberal
S28E05_714#and lose every discussion?
S28E05_716#Every single one?
S28E05_717#Okay, you've already asked too many questions.
S28E05_719#The offer's dead.
S28E05_722#*Empower your horse*
S28E05_724#*Right through the sun*
S28E05_727#*Blast a rainbow light from your empowerment gun*
S28E05_730#So, you're gonna get this to Katy Perry?
S28E05_731#I never said that.
S28E05_733#Hey, guys. Notice anything different?
S28E05_735#Impressive!
S28E05_737#Italian?
S28E05_738#Better.
S28E05_739#Connecticut!
S28E05_742#Yeah, I think I'm gonna go into old man Burns and say,
S28E05_745#"Here is a leader of men... and women."
S28E05_747#'Cause that's what you have to say now.
S28E05_749#High five, man!
S28E05_751#Why do we call it "High five" when we only have four fingers?
S28E05_754#You know, I've always wondered that.
S28E05_755#Oh, what have we here?
S28E05_758#Uh, Lisa, these vials are filled with formaldehyde.
S28E05_761#Formaldehyde! Do you understand?
S28E05_763#Do not imbibe!
S28E05_765#Check. No imbibing.
S28E05_768#Bart! Imbibing is eating, and formaldehyde is poison.
S28E05_771#Oh, you take all the fun out of eating poison.
S28E05_774#You're just an apologist for Krusty.
S28E05_776#I am not a paid apologist for Krusty!
S28E05_778#I didn't say "Paid."
S28E05_780#Got to go. I'll see you in the future.
S28E05_784#Uh, that's just my bathing suit dryer.
S28E05_793#Sorry, kid, not interested in your story.
S28E05_795#Krusty's our biggest star,
S28E05_797#and formaldehyde's our biggest sponsor.
S28E05_799#I'm gonna have to go off the grid.
S28E05_816#All right, Kent Brockman. Welcome to BizzFad.
S28E05_818#We are so crunched.
S28E05_820#Well, the crunching is mutual.
S28E05_822#"The crunching is mutual"? What the hell does that mean?
S28E05_824#Well, I know that the media has changed,
S28E05_827#but this old newshound can still find his way home.
S28E05_830#Okay...
S28E05_832#I thought I might do a piece on all the crazy ice cream flavors
S28E05_834#they have these days.
S28E05_836#Bacon? Really?
S28E05_839#Kent, I like it. I do.
S28E05_841#But we just went bankrupt.
S28E05_843#Uh, people, people, you're all fired.
S28E05_845#But, seriously, it's been a great four days.
S28E05_847#Thank you.
S28E05_850#Uh, gentlemen, I suggest we ramp up production.
S28E05_854#I have a few suggestions right here in my pocket.
S28E05_858#Do it, Homer! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
S28E05_860#Are you Lust?
S28E05_862#No. Lupus.
S28E05_868#Hey, fatso,
S28E05_870#I'd close that tent flap before the mosquitoes get in.
S28E05_872#What the...?
S28E05_874#I thought you would like it.
S28E05_876#Actually, I think you should take this tarp
S28E05_879#back to the baseball stadium you got it from.
S28E05_881#In case there's a rain delay.
S28E05_884#I did not see that coming, sir.
S28E05_885#Off you go, Simpson.
S28E05_887#Never seek to better yourself again.
S28E05_889#I'm just going to shove my foot on your back for emphasis.
S28E05_891#Yes, sir. I understand.
S28E05_893#But could you try not to get my new jacket dirty?
S28E05_896#Sorry, but no.
S28E05_898#Well done, sir.
S28E05_900#Now your turn, Smithers.
S28E05_902#I never thought you'd ask.
S28E05_906#So, why do you want to give the story to Brockman?
S28E05_909#Because the best thing you can do is offer a lifeline
S28E05_912#to a person with no hope.
S28E05_913#Here I am!
S28E05_914#Sorry, not you.
S28E05_915#Thank God!
S28E05_917#Well, how do you know where Brockman will be?
S28E05_919#To find a fallen man,
S28E05_921#you must visit the scene of his highest peak.
S28E05_923#When he reported on the flood of '09.
S28E05_928#My career and these flood waters crested at the same time.
S28E05_931#This is Kent Brockman blowing a sad song
S28E05_933#on his beer bottle.
S28E05_939#Mr. Brockman, we've uncovered a huge story!
S28E05_942#And we need a real newsman to break it wide open.
S28E05_949#A real newsman, eh?
S28E05_951#Then you've come to the wrong corner.
S28E05_952#What do you mean?
S28E05_953#Oh, I'm through.
S28E05_956#Now, please, let me just go out with my remaining dignity intact.
S28E05_960#This is Kent Brockman thinking dark and suicidal thoughts.
S28E05_963#It's quiet here in the gutter.
S28E05_964#Very quiet.
S28E05_965#Well, it was.
S28E05_969#Okay, who would like to start today?
S28E05_972#Anyone? Anyone?
S28E05_975#Oh, come on.
S28E05_980#3  2...
S28E05_982#I'm here live at the support group...
S28E05_983#Our top feeling today...
S28E05_985#This just in: I'm sad.
S28E05_987#You know, I'll be tooling around,
S28E05_990#and I'll just constantly lapse into my elocution exercises.
S28E05_994#"A Lockheed L-1011 landed safely
S28E05_997#in Bogalusa, Louisiana, after an alert."
S28E05_999#Oh, I've been there.
S28E05_1000#- Too true. - Courage.
S28E05_1003#Kent, you're looking unusually thoughtful and silent for an anchor.
S28E05_1006#You know, I thought I'd come to terms
S28E05_1008#with life off the news cycle, and then, bang,
S28E05_1011#I was offered a scoop on a platter.
S28E05_1014#Well, did you leap on that lead like a lion on a lemur?
S28E05_1017#I passed! As in, "I am a thing of the..."
S28E05_1021#Dan Rather, do you have something to contribute
S28E05_1023#besides this delicious homemade Bundt cake?
S28E05_1027#Kent, why are you doing this?
S28E05_1028#Why did you get into this business?
S28E05_1030#Money, women, free coffee. The usual.
S28E05_1034#Sir, if you please, these days, a bona fide uncorrupted story
S28E05_1037#is rarer than a snake with sneakers.
S28E05_1039#It's harder to find than a yellow-fronted bowerbird.
S28E05_1042#Jump on it, hoss,
S28E05_1044#and ride till Gramma churns the buttermilk.
S28E05_1046#That's when the barn dance starts.
S28E05_1048#What is that feeling?
S28E05_1049#Is it integrity?
S28E05_1057#Good to see ya, buddy. I'm in!
S28E05_1059#Anybody got eyeliner and pancake makeup?
S28E05_1061#Take mine, brother.
S28E05_1063#Works great on Mediterranean skin.
S28E05_1065#It's from my personal line, Rather Handsome.
S28E05_1069#Well, Marge, I was humiliated by Mr. Burns, it's true.
S28E05_1073#But, to me, this is nothing more than a temporary setback.
S28E05_1076#Good for you, Homie. I'm proud of you.
S28E05_1079#Hey, Homer Simpson is not deterred
S28E05_1081#by a footprint on his suit.
S28E05_1082#It'll come out, right?
S28E05_1083#I don't know.
S28E05_1087#Homer, I have a 12-step plan for your success.
S28E05_1089#Step number one: get in a 12-step plan.
S28E05_1100#This is an opportunity!
S28E05_1103#I think I'm going to Moe's.
S28E05_1107#Krusty, we have evidence that your product
S28E05_1109#is laced with toxic additives.
S28E05_1111#Yeah. So why you bothering me?
S28E05_1113#Because your tasty little treat did this.
S28E05_1117#I made the doctor cry.
S28E05_1120#They told me the paralysis would be temporary!
S28E05_1122#Five years, tops.
S28E05_1124#Seriously, come on,
S28E05_1126#that kid wasn't going anywhere anyway.
S28E05_1129#It looks like this clown could not formalde-hide the truth.
S28E05_1132#This is Kent Brockman, saying...
S28E05_1134#No! I'm gonna sing Beatles songs
S28E05_1135#so you can't afford to show this video!
S28E05_1137#- A-one, two, three, four! - Too late!
S28E05_1141#Well, you're back on top, Kent.
S28E05_1143#And now for a once monthly feature we do called Serious Question.
S28E05_1147#Tell us, how did you get this story?
S28E05_1148#Well, it's funny, actually.
S28E05_1150#I was trapped in a burning building...
S28E05_1152#Is he really gonna take all the credit for this?
S28E05_1154#Don't ask me.
S28E05_1156#The last newsman I could trust
S28E05_1158#was that bigamist, Charles Kuralt.
S28E05_1161#It was a burning building called my career.
S28E05_1163#Thank God I had help.
S28E05_1165#Lisa Simpson, you deserve to be on this couch with me.
S28E05_1168#But because I don't lie anymore,
S28E05_1170#I have to say I didn't fight too hard when they said no.
S28E05_1173#Is that enough?
S28E05_1174#Are you kidding?
S28E05_1176#You got Hollywood's highest honor:

S28E05_1193#Are you almost through?
S28E05_1195#In a hurry to fail again, Kent?!
S28E05_1197#No, it's just I've been off the air for six weeks,
S28E05_1199#and it was torture.
S28E05_1200#Sometimes I'd watch Bill O'Reilly
S28E05_1202#and pretend it was an older, stupider version of me.

S28E06_86#polishing and buffing our robot masters.
S28E06_88#Indeed.

S28E06_130#that can eat up all our free time.
S28E06_132#What about baseball?
S28E06_133#Baseball...
S28E06_134#Rife with steroids!
S28E06_136#Then test for steroids!

S28E06_141#Um, I think I-I may have a solution.
S28E06_142#Wait, wait, wait, wait.
S28E06_143#What about biathlon?

S28E06_319#What matters is you tried your best.
S28E06_322#Have an orange slice.
S28E06_323#No, we won!
S28E06_325#Yes, we're all winners.
S28E06_328#Because losing teaches valuable lessons.

S28E06_373#How do you know so much about lacrosse?

S28E06_380#Well, it all goes back to my college days,
S28E06_382#{\an8}7:7
S28E06_383#where I was the star attackman on our lacrosse team.
S28E06_387#{\an8}8:7
S28E06_392#I'd even been drafted to play in the pros
S28E06_394#for the Milwaukee Zoom.
S28E06_396#After scoring the championship-winning goal,
S28E06_398#I was on top of the world, man.

S28E06_402#For the first time in my life,
S28E06_404#no one, and I mean no one, was leaving me hanging.
S28E06_406#I was slap-happy,
S28E06_408#I couldn't stop myself, until...
S28E06_411#I highed one five too far.
S28E06_417#Our school mascot, Sir Gudge-a-lot.
S28E06_423#My Zoom dream died that day.
S28E06_432#My wrist healed, but my wrist in here...
S28E06_434#never did.
S28E06_436#I've never high-fived my own son.
S28E06_439#The mascot wore a suit of armor?
S28E06_441#Just like a knight!
S28E06_443#Yeah, but now lacrosse has brought us together.
S28E06_445#Hey, a toast, to new friendship!
S28E06_448#Could I get a roll of toilet paper, please?
S28E06_450#I get nosebleeds when I drink.
S28E06_454#To... new... friendship.
S28E06_462#- Dad! Dad! - Dad! Dad!
S28E06_464#Dad, wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
S28E06_475#It's 6 am on a saturday.

S28E06_513#I'm pretty sure a mixtape 
S28E06_515#isn't just the same song over and over again.
S28E06_518#No, no, dude, they're different live versions.
S28E06_521#You can tell because some are longer.
S28E06_524#Hey, you want a hit off my vape pen?

S28E06_528#and people think you're a smoker.
S28E06_529#Why would I want that?
S28E06_532#Don't worry, marge isn't here.
S28E06_533#Oh, speaking of which,
S28E06_535#where is the craziest place
S28E06_537#you two have ever done it?
S28E06_539#- What? - Let's both say it at the same time.
S28E06_541#One... two...
S28E06_542#- Don't! - Chipotle!
S28E06_544#There are kids back there!
S28E06_546#Oh, they can't hear us.
S28E06_548#I got 'em watching classic lacrosse matches.
S28E06_552#Textbook ankle-breaker by Gary Gait!
S28E06_555#And Paul Gait with the dip and dunk!
S28E06_558#Everyone be sure to fuel up with a rice sandwich.
S28E06_567#Rice in a sandwich?
S28E06_568#That's mush-on-mush.
S28E06_570#Doesn't this dweeb know kids need bologna to win?
S28E06_573#Those sandwiches had so many carbs!
S28E06_575#I've never played harder!

S28E06_602#Kirk is like a sports genius who everyone hates.
S28E06_605#Worse than Jim Harbaugh?
S28E06_607#Well, not that bad.
S28E06_609#I know Kirk's a bit of a dizzy duck,
S28E06_611#but remember, you're doing this for the kids.
S28E06_613#Right, right. The kids.
S28E06_615#Everything for the kids.
S28E06_616#Oh, God, he's coming!
S28E06_617#Hide, Marge.
S28E06_621#Oh, good call, buddy.
S28E06_622#Disco nap.
S28E06_624#We got to power up for tonight.
S28E06_625#Tonight?
S28E06_627#Which gentlemen's club should we hit first,
S28E06_629#Skin City or the Tassel Castle?
S28E06_630#Gentlemen's...
S28E06_632#you mean a strip club?
S28E06_634#Yeah, Wiggles has great dancers,
S28E06_636#but they're kind of stuck up,
S28E06_638#if you believe Lap-Aficionado.Com.
S28E06_640#Which, uh... I do.
S28E06_642#Why would I want to go to a strip club?
S28E06_644#I'm married to a naked lady.
S28E06_646#Drive time to Sapphire Diamond is only 39 minutes.
S28E06_649#That's the fastest it's been all day.
S28E06_651#Hey, wa... 38 minutes!
S28E06_653#Listen, Kirk, I'm a lot of kind of guys...
S28E06_655#A booze guy,
S28E06_657#a don't-know-my-kids'- birthdays guy,
S28E06_659#a steal-the-blow-dryer- from-the-motel guy,
S28E06_662#but I am not a strip club guy.
S28E06_665#You do want to hang with me, don't you, buddy?
S28E06_668#I can't do it.
S28E06_670#I can't pretend to be this guy's friend for one more second.
S28E06_673#I scored three goals today!
S28E06_675#I'm a jock. A jock!
S28E06_678#I didn't spit on my hand for the post-game handshake.
S28E06_680#Hey, pal, I don't like Kirk either,
S28E06_683#but look how much fun the kids' heads are having.
S28E06_688#Of course I want to hang with you, buddy.
S28E06_690#But, you know, I'm pretty tired from all those YouTube videos
S28E06_693#you showed me about whiskey making.

S28E06_697#I know, the barrel.
S28E06_699#Let's just get some sleep.
S28E06_701#Well, all right.
S28E06_703#Next time we can just rage twice as hard, I guess.

S28E06_851#Springfield,
S28E06_853#the city that lives and dies by youth lacrosse,

S28E06_878#Coach K!
S28E06_886#It's not like Kirk to miss such an important pre-game rally.
S28E06_889#Yeah, well, better get slicing on these oranges.
S28E06_891#Where is that coach?
S28E06_893#If we lose this game,
S28E06_895#I have to give the mayor of Capital City
S28E06_897#a crate of Springfield apricots.

S28E06_900#Kirk is missing.
S28E06_902#I haven't seen him since he left home

S28E06_908#Dad, what do you know?
S28E06_909#What? Nothing!
S28E06_911#I don't... oh, oh...
S28E06_913#All right.
S28E06_916#The truth is, your husband and your father
S28E06_919#is a soul-sucking loser who found out
S28E06_922#I was only pretending to be his friend for the sake of the team.
S28E06_925#But, but why did he empty out our bank account,
S28E06_928#and all in one-dollar bills?
S28E06_929#Oh, no.
S28E06_931#There's only one thing a man like Kirk wants

S28E06_934#To hand out to the poor?
S28E06_936#Worse.
S28E06_937#To bring to a strip club.
S28E06_939#I'll go get him.
S28E06_941#- I'll also get him. - No, me! Me!
S28E06_943#I just need to go home and put on my special sweat pants.
S28E06_946#No, it's my husband's fault
S28E06_949#that Kirk has run off to that jiggle joint
S28E06_951#and only he can get him out.
S28E06_952#Me?
S28E06_954#But those places are filled with creeps.
S28E06_957#Plus, all the chairs face the stage.
S28E06_959#What if I want to have a conversation with another patron?
S28E06_961#Come on, Dad, you've got to do it!
S28E06_963#Without Coach K, we can't play in the championship!

S28E06_1038#No, thank you.

S28E06_1041#No, thank you.
S28E06_1043#Happily married man with no cash coming through.

S28E06_1048#Nothing in this place can tempt me.
S28E06_1052#Oh, baby, yes.
S28E06_1054#Those legs go on forever.
S28E06_1057#Where are they?
S28E06_1059#Maybe we shouldn't have sent Homer Simpson

S28E06_1063#My husband's a good man.
S28E06_1065#He can do this.
S28E06_1068#Oh, worst food I've ever had.
S28E06_1070#So much...
S28E06_1072#Is that guy still in the champagne room?
S28E06_1074#He hasn't slept in days.
S28E06_1076#He brought a cooler of rice sandwiches.
S28E06_1078#He says they give him energy.
S28E06_1081#Wait, who do I know that likes rice sandwiches?
S28E06_1084#Bart's friend's dad!
S28E06_1088#So anyway, they can't call it bourbon
S28E06_1090#unless it's from Kentucky.
S28E06_1091#It's the American bourbon...
S28E06_1093#He's not a loser paying for lap dances;
S28E06_1096#he's a loser paying for listening.
S28E06_1098#Kirk, we've got to go.

S28E06_1102#Come on... buddy?

S28E06_1109#Carmeleena and Bodacious are my true friends.
S28E06_1112#Nothing, nothing that we had was real.
S28E06_1115#Well, it was all fake.
S28E06_1117#But, damn it, somehow you turned our fat, lazy, 
S28E06_1119#loser kids into winners.
S28E06_1121#Kirk Van Houten, I don't like you.
S28E06_1124#But I respect you.

S28E06_1133#I've got to get to that game!
S28E06_1136#Hey, that's a great realization you had there, pally.
S28E06_1138#Now if we could just settle this up, eh?
S28E06_1140#$15,000?
S28E06_1142#12 lap-dances an hour, 
S28E06_1144#times three girls, times 56 hours,

S28E06_1160#Japanese businessmen!
S28E06_1163#ATM with giant service fee!
S28E06_1167#Aw, we'll never make it to the game.
S28E06_1170#Our kids were depending on us and we let them down.
S28E06_1173#You let them down. You.
S28E06_1174#Did you say kids?
S28E06_1176#We all have kids.
S28E06_1178#We'd do anything for 'em.
S28E06_1183#Come on, working moms, let's get these dads to that game.
S28E06_1186#I'm sorry, kids, but your coaches aren't here.
S28E06_1187#You're going to have to forfeit.
S28E06_1189#And now to blow this whistle and make it official.
S28E06_1194#It's the Strip-a-copter!
S28E06_1196#I mean, it's a helicopter I've never rented before.
S28E06_1202#Helmet up, kids.

S28E06_1218#they'll always have this moment.
S28E06_1220#Buddy, you deserve this.
S28E06_1225#Just because we're in traction
S28E06_1227#doesn't mean this hospital room can't swing.

S28E07_151#There's a stain.
S28E07_153#Did that dumb dog pee on the rug?
S28E07_156#Dad, it's not fair to blame the dog.
S28E07_158#Blame the dumb animal who's supposed to walk him:
S28E07_160#Bart.

S28E07_165#?Chewing your leg is not a yes,

S28E07_172#What? ?Huh?

S28E07_195#We're paying the finest nursing home in town.
S28E07_197#They'll know what to do.
S28E07_199#We have no idea what to do.

S28E07_224#You're not staying on skid row.
S28E07_225#Yeah, that's shameful,
S28E07_227#shoving poor old people out on the street.
S28E07_230#This place is for the mentally ill.
S28E07_233#Hey! What are you...
S28E07_234#Uh, get better!
S28E07_238#Well, we're not beaten yet.
S28E07_241#Grampa, you're a veteran of every branch of the service.
S28E07_243#The VA hospital will help.
S28E07_246#Aren't those hospitals the ones they called "America's shame"?
S28E07_249#A lot of things are America's shame, honey.

S28E07_259#Yes?
S28E07_261#Uh, this is just the waiting room.
S28E07_264#Well, don't worry, the veteran's administration
S28E07_266#will take care of this proud warrior.
S28E07_268#I can see him in five minutes.

S28E07_273#Hey, soldier.
S28E07_275#Are you looking for high quality health care at no cost?
S28E07_277#I know the place.
S28E07_279#Tell it to me in an anecdote.
S28E07_280#Years ago,
S28E07_282#I saw action in the Bay of Pigs.
S28E07_285#Bay of Pigs, eh?
S28E07_292#Er, have you seen Marilyn Monroe?
S28E07_294#I'm asking, for, uh, for a friend.
S28E07_296#Yes, a, uh... Er, uh...
S28E07_298#...A friend. Don't, uh, tell Ethel.
S28E07_300#History.
S28E07_302#Those Cuban doctors patched me up good,
S28E07_305#and for a lot less.
S28E07_306#How much less?
S28E07_308#Well, what costs $2,000 here
S28E07_311#costs six bucks there.
S28E07_316#Ah, Cuba sounds a little dangerous.
S28E07_318#Why don't we try Canada?
S28E07_319#I don't want to go there,
S28E07_321#now that that commie Trudeau is in charge.
S28E07_324#We're goin' to Cuba!
S28E07_325#You got it, Dad.
S28E07_327#Nurse, cancel our appointment.
S28E07_328#I'm sorry, there's a fee
S28E07_330#if you don't cancel within 24 years.
S28E07_339#Grampa, can't you enjoy the Caribbean breeze?
S28E07_343#Not while I suspect your father's gonna toss me off'n the boat.
S28E07_350#No. We're not.
S28E07_352#And we'll have fun when we get there.
S28E07_354#We can have plantains.
S28E07_356#They're like bananas you have to cook. Yum.
S28E07_359#Cooked bananas are too hard for me to chew.
S28E07_363#Well, don't forget Cuba's vibrant jazz scene.
S28E07_365#Lisa, thanks for the warning.
S28E07_368#Despite what she says, this trip will be fun.
S28E07_371#I am finally gonna put the Spanish I learned
S28E07_373#on I Love Lucy to use.
S28E07_375#Oh, Loo-sey, you need to see a "Fee-sa-kia-trist."

S28E07_379#We are perfectly able to pronounce "Psychiatrist."
S28E07_382#Now, please don't make me 'splain it to you again.
S28E07_384#Come on, Rick. The girls are dressed up like men,
S28E07_386#trying to get into the cigar store.
S28E07_388#So you know what we do, Fred?
S28E07_390#We give them cigars.
S28E07_393#All the cigars they want.
S28E07_396#This will be good.
S28E07_398#I'll never understand why a bandleader
S28E07_400#was such good friends with his landlord.

S28E07_442#I'm a journalist.
S28E07_444#I'm doing an article for my school paper.
S28E07_446#Here's one of my scoops.
S28E07_448#You're in.
S28E07_452#Whoa, you can make money playing dominoes?
S28E07_454#Come on, Grampa, let's take these guys.
S28E07_456#I don't like dominoes.
S28E07_458#With my cataracts, everything's a six.
S28E07_463#What?
S28E07_470#We could go see 
S28E07_472#Mariel ?Hemingway's grandfather's house.
S28E07_474#Hmm, apparently, he was a writer.
S28E07_476#Like Mindy Kaling.
S28E07_478#Forget it, I'm done.
S28E07_480#Let me just take one last good look at my granddaughter
S28E07_483#so she'll remember her granddad.
S28E07_493#And love locks it in.
S28E07_495#Now, to just sit and wait for the end.
S28E07_500#How could anyone be so glum in front of that sign?
S28E07_507#I am so sorry.
S28E07_509#There is, uh, nothing I can do.
S28E07_511#All I can offer is this, uh, festive shirt.
S28E07_515#I don't like the way the birds are looking at me.
S28E07_518#Relax, viejo.

S28E07_530#Oh, my God!
S28E07_532#Where have you been all these years?
S28E07_534#Now, this is a car!
S28E07_536#Razor-sharp fins.
S28E07_538#Little triangle windows that weren't good for nothing.
S28E07_542#And a front seat you could fit all your newborn babies on.
S28E07_545#Would you care to go for a ride?
S28E07_548#Car keys that don't go bloopity-bloop!
S28E07_550#I'm home!
S28E07_562#You, my friend,
S28E07_564#just had a "Cuba-gasm."
S28E07_567#Dad, let me help you out.
S28E07_570#I don't need no help!
S28E07_574#A lungful of leaded gas and I'm better than ever!
S28E07_578#Oh, thank you.
S28E07_580#You've taken my dad back to a simpler time
S28E07_584#when our only worry was being obliterated by nuclear weapons.
S28E07_587#It is the car.
S28E07_590#All our American cars were built before 1960.
S28E07_593#And studies show that exposure to objects from your youth
S28E07_596#can help you feel young again.
S28E07_598#What studies?
S28E07_599#Are they peer reviewed?
S28E07_600#You know what they are?
S28E07_602#A professor, Ellen Langer, did a study
S28E07_605#where seniors exposed to culture from the '50s
S28E07_608#became more vigorous and engaged.
S28E07_611#They even engaged in heavy petting.
S28E07_614#There's heavy petting?
S28E07_619#Wow, that's the first time I've seen him
S28E07_621#get a woman's attention without flatlining.
S28E07_625#Now, here's one that's been in our family for years.
S28E07_636#Well, that saves us going to the beach.
S28E07_642#Okay, so let me get this straight.
S28E07_645#This paladar is a restaurant,
S28E07_648#but it's in a home?
S28E07_649#That's right.
S28E07_651#So I don't have to do the dishes?
S28E07_652#You don't do the dishes at home.
S28E07_655#Never discuss family business in front of the Cubans.
S28E07_659#Homie, this place is so homey.
S28E07_662#Look, Grampa's eating like a horse.
S28E07_664#So, you are enjoying the horse?
S28E07_666#No, no, no.
S28E07_668#You are not eating a horse.
S28E07_670#The baby is.
S28E07_672#How many bites have you had?
S28E07_678#Gracias. ?C¨®mo est¨¢s t¨²?
S28E07_680#Bart, you're using informal Spanish
S28E07_682#with someone who's not a family member.
S28E07_684#Ay, caramba.
S28E07_686#Quiet, you kids. I'm watching Castro.
S28E07_688#All the best world leaders have beards.
S28E07_690#Him, Santa Claus.
S28E07_692#And every time he says "Collective farming,"
S28E07_693#I take a drink.
S28E07_696#Recientemente, viaj¨¦ a una granja colectiva.
S28E07_700#Gracias!
S28E07_706#Look at me, Jasper!
S28E07_708#I'm eating a peanut!
S28E07_710#Who's that guy?
S28E07_711#Huh? Who knows?
S28E07_713#But I'm sending him a picture of my junk.
S28E07_717#Ugh. Disgusting.
S28E07_719#300 extra pesos
S28E07_722#por la hermosa camarera.
S28E07_725#Yo no salgo con clientes.
S28E07_728#Another El Presidente cocktail, Se?or Abraham?
S28E07_732#I don't remember telling you my name.
S28E07_734#You did. In fact, you were so charming,
S28E07_736#I want to hook up later.
S28E07_739#Not for money but for nylons and chocolate.
S28E07_742#Hey, Macarena!
S28E07_744#For me, that's a topical reference.
S28E07_746#Why don't you let me buy this round, Abe?
S28E07_749#Wheels McGrath?! I knew you in the Air Force!
S28E07_752#I haven't seen you since you dropped that A-bomb
S28E07_754#off the forklift.
S28E07_757#Yeah, 'member when it just kept rollin' and rollin'?
S28E07_761#Oh, you're looking good, Abe.
S28E07_762#Cuba's great.
S28E07_764#It's like Florida before all the Cubans came.
S28E07_767#So what happened to you?
S28E07_770#I-I hijacked a plane here in the '70s.
S28E07_773#Wow! Did you have the chicken or fish?
S28E07_775#I had both.
S28E07_777#Crazy!
S28E07_779#Listen, there's a place I want to take you.
S28E07_782#What do you say? For old times' sake?
S28E07_783#Yeah, why not?
S28E07_785#Keep my tab open, Issabella.
S28E07_787#I hope I see you again, Abelito.
S28E07_790#You will. I never go anyplace new.
S28E07_793#So, you just sign the papers and she's committed, huh?
S28E07_795#That's right.
S28E07_797#That'll zap the sass out of her.
S28E07_799#Yes. Yes!
S28E07_802#The future of Angola is the future of Cuba!
S28E07_814#Are you sure we had to take this route?
S28E07_815#Hey, I like hacking.
S28E07_818#Are you ready for the surprise of your life?
S28E07_820#Can you give it to me in stages?
S28E07_823#?There she is,
S28E07_825#the most hijacked plane in history.
S28E07_828#All you had to say was your kid wanted a pair of wings,
S28E07_831#and you were in the cockpit.
S28E07_833#I remember their motto,
S28E07_835#Skyhawk Air: Nobody try to be a hero.
S28E07_838#It's all ready to open as a nightclub, Abe.
S28E07_841#All we have to do is clean it up
S28E07_844#and hack a 50-foot-wide path to civilization.
S28E07_847#Couldn't we just burn a path?
S28E07_849#No, I'll do the hacking. I'll do that.
S28E07_851#All I need is a front man and a partner.
S28E07_853#You expect me to give you the money
S28E07_855#I was gonna leave to Homer?
S28E07_858#Okay, I'm in!
S28E07_860#We'll fix that.
S28E07_862#See? Fixed.
S28E07_868#It's about time!
S28E07_869#We leave at 2:00!
S28E07_871#You leave at 2:00. I'm staying here.
S28E07_874#Dad, you can't stay in Cuba.
S28E07_878#For the first time in years, I feel young and healthy.
S28E07_880#And I found love!
S28E07_882#Don't you want those things for me?
S28E07_884#But I can't even leave you in the park
S28E07_886#without you losing your wallet in a bush.
S28E07_888#It was an investment!
S28E07_893#So you want to stay and be with your Cuban chica?
S28E07_896#She makes me weak in the knees!
S28E07_898#You're always weak in the knees.
S28E07_900#That's because I had to sell my cartilage in the '70s,
S28E07_903#and that cartilage became part of Hank Aaron's wrist.
S28E07_906#Dad, you're happy now because the new thing
S28E07_907#is always exciting.
S28E07_909#Remember when you got that new pillow?
S28E07_912#Oh, that was a mighty fine pillow.
S28E07_914#Hypoallergenic.
S28E07_916#Oh, what kind of father would you be if you left me now?
S28E07_919#Son, all you see in me is a burden!
S28E07_925#Think of me every time you don't visit someone!

S28E07_966#Thank you.
S28E07_969#How did they know my name?
S28E07_974#I don't know where my dad is.

S28E07_995#Bam! Done!
S28E07_998#Andre here sold secrets to the Soviets.
S28E07_1001#And this is the guy
S28E07_1004#who came up with the service fee for Ticketmaster.
S28E07_1007#Do you know any good people?
S28E07_1009#Everyone's got their embarrassments, Abe.
S28E07_1011#I'm sure you got yours.
S28E07_1012#Dad!
S28E07_1014#And up he walks.
S28E07_1017#What are you doing here? Who are these people?
S28E07_1019#This guy was the biggest drug lord in North American history.
S28E07_1022#And this guy invented Ticketmaster.
S28E07_1025#You charged me to sell me something!
S28E07_1027#Pleased to meet you, sir.
S28E07_1030#Abe, come with me
S28E07_1031#to the cockpit.
S28E07_1033#Are we gonna fly or make love?
S28E07_1035#You will sit there, move nothing,
S28E07_1036#and do as I say.
S28E07_1038#Hot dog! Makin' love!
S28E07_1046#Miami, this is Jitterbug Justice

S28E07_1058#Can't we hold on to anything?
S28E07_1061#Boy, I didn't think I'd ever be able to do this again!
S28E07_1064#All you have done is fly without falling asleep.
S28E07_1067#Just like on my honeymoon.
S28E07_1070#I'm starting to suspect you're not a simple Cuban bartender.
S28E07_1073#No, I'm an undercover agent for the CIA
S28E07_1076#here to recapture fugitives from U.S. Law.
S28E07_1079#And when I saw you, I realized you'd be the perfect carcass
S28E07_1081#to tempt these old buzzards.
S28E07_1085#Is there anything I get out of this?
S28E07_1087#Yes. You avoid the knockout gas.
S28E07_1093#Oh, thank God.
S28E07_1095#Usually I can never sleep on planes.
S28E07_1097#Sometimes I...

S28E07_1115#And like every good thing in my life,

S28E07_1119#Listen, Dad, I know it was fun,
S28E07_1120#but your place is with us,

S28E07_1131#Oh, now we're two men hugging.
S28E07_1134#This is no sight for the streets of Miami.

S28E07_1141#It's a beautiful day.
S28E07_1142#Want to hit the links?
S28E07_1144#Oh, just like we used to.
S28E07_1151#Screw you!
S28E07_1160#Look over there.
S28E07_1164#I just painted a black circle on the green.
S28E07_1166#Why, you little...!
S28E07_1177#Now, boy, it's 50 cents a golf ball
S28E07_1179#from that water hazard.
S28E07_1181#Just move those logs aside.
S28E07_1185#Next on Vulture's Nest...

S28E08_155#Who's a good Allen wrench?
S28E08_157#You's a good Allen wrench.
S28E08_158#Come here.
S28E08_161#Come on.
S28E08_168#Huh? That isn't the same Allen wrench I swallowed.
S28E08_175#Hey, Barney, how's it going?
S28E08_176#Fine. How are you?
S28E08_178#I need help. Can you come right over?
S28E08_182#Homer, you should use the Choremonkey app.
S28E08_185#People do all your chores,
S28E08_187#so you're free to follow your dreams.
S28E08_190#My dream right now is beer and toilet paper.
S28E08_194#Mr. Gumble, because I'm a decent person,
S28E08_197#this is the last beer I'm going to bring you.
S28E08_199#I'll just use Uburp.
S28E08_204#Stop eating me, I'm not dead yet!
S28E08_208#Choremonkey to the rescue.
S28E08_211#Oh, thank you.
S28E08_214#I think this is the beginning of an unhealthy dependence.
S28E08_220#*I'm a fool to do my dirty work*
S28E08_226#*I can hire all these nerdy jerks*

S28E08_238#*I ain't gonna do my dirty work*
S28E08_241#*No more*
S28E08_244#*Gonna leave my socks and dirty shirt*
S28E08_247#*On the floor*
S28E08_248#Homie,
S28E08_249#I don't like that the house
S28E08_251#is full of strangers all the time.
S28E08_253#And I-- wait, wait, why are you taking out your phone?
S28E08_256#No. Don't you Choremonkey me!
S28E08_259#Sweetie, you know I'm no good at arguments,
S28E08_261#so I brought in a professional.
S28E08_263#Hello, ma'am, my name's Blake,
S28E08_265#and I'm a retired FBI hostage negotiator.
S28E08_267#I wouldn't say this is a hostage situation.
S28E08_270#Mm, no one said it was, ma'am.
S28E08_271#I'm just here to listen.
S28E08_273#So that was step one: listening.
S28E08_274#Next, empathy.
S28E08_276#I'm standing right here, you know.
S28E08_278#Mm, it must be frustrating for you to hear me talk
S28E08_280#like you're invisible.
S28E08_282#It is. It is.
S28E08_284#Step three: I build a rapport.
S28E08_286#You know, I love the color scheme in your home.
S28E08_289#I feel like you're saying that just to build a rapport with me.
S28E08_292#Wow, that's very observant.
S28E08_294#Very wise.
S28E08_295#Oh, well, thank you.
S28E08_296#Nice.
S28E08_298#This ain't my first rodeo.
S28E08_299#Marge, right now
S28E08_301#I bet you wish you were just back home in your kitchen.
S28E08_304#I am back home in my kitchen!
S28E08_305#Then life is good.
S28E08_306#Am I right?
S28E08_308#You are.
S28E08_310#While I'm here, could I also fix your icemaker?
S28E08_311#Yes.
S28E08_312#Oh, yes.
S28E08_314#Blake, I adore you.
S28E08_316#Shh. It's over now.
S28E08_317#Go get some rest.
S28E08_322#Homer, can we throw the ball around?
S28E08_325#By "We," I mean me and your chore monkey.
S28E08_328#Oh, of course! Sure, buddy.
S28E08_330#For you I'll get one without a criminal record.
S28E08_332#Which means I'll have to use Choremonkey Gold.
S28E08_337#Good one, Bart.
S28E08_339#Wait, are you Heisman Trophy-winner Matt Leinart?
S28E08_341#Yep, I am.
S28E08_343#And you need this job?
S28E08_345#Yeah, I haven't really been smart with my money after football.
S28E08_351#But what about your broadcasting work?
S28E08_353#Uh, sunk it all into my Thai-Irish fusion restaurant,

S28E08_362#On the plus side, he taught me how to throw a perfect spiral.
S28E08_365#Yes!
S28E08_366#Frozen rope, kiddo!
S28E08_368#Love you, man.
S28E08_369#I love you.
S28E08_372#Maybe I should play a little catch with my son now.
S28E08_375#Whatever, Hoss, let's see what you got.
S28E08_378#My zinnias!
S28E08_379#Annuals.
S28E08_381#Wait, please, just let me try again.
S28E08_384#Dad, you're embarrassing me in front of Matt Leinart.
S28E08_386#But...
S28E08_388#You made that for me?
S28E08_389#No, it used to be O.J.'s.
S28E08_391#Yeah, Little Juice.
S28E08_393#Oh, stupid Choremonkey.
S28E08_395#Another thing I overdo bites me in the butt.
S28E08_404#You're late.
S28E08_406#There's no specified time, sir.
S28E08_408#And you did receive progress alerts.
S28E08_409#Whatever, fine.
S28E08_410#Just throw the damn ball.
S28E08_413#- So, how was your day? - ?Pretty good.
S28E08_416#I've thrown various balls with six different middle-aged men.
S28E08_419#All right, stop talking, you're ruining it.
S28E08_421#?Nice pass, sir.
S28E08_422#For someone your age.
S28E08_424#Ju-- This isn't fun at all.
S28E08_425#- I'm done. - ?Fine.
S28E08_427#You know the monkeys also rate the customers.
S28E08_431#Now everyone will know what kind of man you are.
S28E08_433#Good-bye, Tyler.
S28E08_434#Jerk.
S28E08_437#"Jerk." Bart used to call me that.
S28E08_442#Be careful, Dad.
S28E08_444#Being careful is not going to get us
S28E08_446#on America's Funniest Home Videos.
S28E08_449#Now, when I nod, you pull the bottom brick out
S28E08_451#and the wall falls on me.
S28E08_453#Then call Vin Di Bona Productions,
S28E08_455#then an ambulance.
S28E08_457#Wait. Won't they know this video is fake?
S28E08_459#Why would I be filming you making a wall?
S28E08_462#Why didn't you bring these things up
S28E08_463#at the production meeting?
S28E08_464#Well, it's too late now!
S28E08_466#Oh, great!
S28E08_468#Dad, can I get you one of my children's Xanax?
S28E08_472#What I need is that $10,000 prize.
S28E08_475#Not $5,000. I already spent that on bricks.
S28E08_477#Now pull that rope.
S28E08_479#If I pull the rope and it kills you,
S28E08_482#I'll need a lot of therapy.
S28E08_484#I'm not gonna die, son.
S28E08_486#Uh, but if I do, can you play "Nobody Does It Better"
S28E08_488#at my funeral on the recorder?
S28E08_490#I can't be a part of this.
S28E08_492#Yeah, yeah, you're right.
S28E08_494#Luann, help!
S28E08_496#I'm in a hurry.
S28E08_499#Well, at least I got it on video.
S28E08_501#Delete.
S28E08_503#come on.
S28E08_510#Dad, it's me.
S28E08_514#What are you doing here? It's not pudding day.
S28E08_517#My son doesn't want to be with me anymore.
S28E08_520#So you realize that's how you've treated me all these years
S28E08_523#and you've come to apologize.
S28E08_525#Look, Dad, I would visit more
S28E08_527#if I hadn't put you in such a depressing place.
S28E08_528#Whatever.
S28E08_530#I've got a real problem here.
S28E08_532#I'm gonna be a father again!
S28E08_534#My girlfriend's pregnant.
S28E08_536#That's insane!
S28E08_538#I leave you alone for six months and this is what happens?
S28E08_541#How did you even meet her?
S28E08_543#Oh, this home just got the Internet
S28E08_545#and everyone's using senior dating sites.
S28E08_547#Gray Date,
S28E08_548#Friends with Social Security Benefits.
S28E08_551#Everyone's making whoopee and hanky-panky.
S28E08_554#A few are even having sex.
S28E08_557#You can't leave me.
S28E08_559#We started a puzzle together.
S28E08_561#My heart's bleeding.
S28E08_562#Seriously.
S28E08_564#Please call 911.
S28E08_570#Abraham Simpson.
S28E08_572#Are you skipping town on me?
S28E08_574#No, no. I like you.
S28E08_576#It's the baby I'm skipping town on.
S28E08_578#You don't want our baby?
S28E08_581#Before you judge me, look where my DNA leads.
S28E08_583#I'm fine.
S28E08_587#I think he's sweet.
S28E08_589#Would he like to play with my keys?
S28E08_591#I am a normal person, and yes.
S28E08_594#All right, I'll man up.
S28E08_596#But remember, men of my generation
S28E08_598#don't change a diaper, attend a birth,
S28E08_601#or talk to the child before he's drafted.
S28E08_604#I couldn't ask for more.
S28E08_609#I thought you just rolled.
S28E08_610#Those were my knees.
S28E08_612#Rent six dollars?!
S28E08_614#You can't even buy a Monopoly set for that.
S28E08_617#Great commentary, Bart.
S28E08_618#Love you, man.
S28E08_619#I love you.
S28E08_621#Hi, I'm Matt.
S28E08_622#Milhouse.
S28E08_623#I'm Bart's best friend.
S28E08_625#Aw, sounds like someone wants an autograph.
S28E08_627#I do.
S28E08_629#Who are you?
S28E08_630#I misspelled my name.
S28E08_631#But that makes it worth more.
S28E08_633#Come on, Leinart, get your head in the game.
S28E08_635#Bart, I got a straight up swap.
S28E08_637#How 'bout I give you Boardwalk and Park Place,
S28E08_639#and you give me Ventnor?
S28E08_641#That's crazy talk.
S28E08_642#Oh, yeah?
S28E08_643#What "History of Board Games" Class did you take
S28E08_645#when you were in college?
S28E08_647#My friend, you have a deal.
S28E08_651#You got Chance.
S28E08_653#"Take a walk on the Boardwalk,"
S28E08_654#which I now own, and you're bankrupt
S28E08_656#and I win.
S28E08_658#Wow, you beat me at every game,
S28E08_660#even Heisman Trophy Trivial Pursuit.
S28E08_662#Oh! Can I play Bart next?
S28E08_664#I carry my own little top hat with me.
S28E08_667#Is this guy bothering you, Bart?
S28E08_669#I'll make sure he finds the door.
S28E08_671#Could you throw me out in a perfect spiral?
S28E08_674#I can walk you out in a straight line.
S28E08_677#No one's gonna believe that at school.
S28E08_684#"Always let him win"?
S28E08_687#"Don't let him see this sheet"?
S28E08_689#He called me the greatest receiver he'd ever thrown to.
S28E08_691#Was that a lie, too?
S28E08_692#Get out there.
S28E08_695#Hey, Mr. Simpson.
S28E08_696#Hey, Milk Dud.
S28E08_698#Uh, listen, I got to go change the oil in my car.
S28E08_701#Don't you want to get a Choremonkey?
S28E08_702#They cut me off.
S28E08_704#I never dreamed when I gave 'em my credit card number
S28E08_706#that they would charge me.
S28E08_708#You could help me out if you want.
S28E08_709#I have an old shirt you could wear.
S28E08_711#An old shirt!
S28E08_713#My dad doesn't have any of those.
S28E08_718#Anyone ever tell you that you're excellent at gluing?
S28E08_720#Um, no.
S28E08_723#And your rubber cement boogers were very convincing.
S28E08_726#Look, I know you're doing this because you have to.
S28E08_727#How would you like it if the other team
S28E08_728#had just let you win all the time?
S28E08_730#That would have been really great.
S28E08_733#Listen, I have another Choremonkey job.
S28E08_734#I'll see you around.
S28E08_742#Wait, I don't think a bouncer throws people into a bar.
S28E08_744#Yeah, yeah, yeah. You just bounce, all right?
S28E08_746#I'll tell you which way.
S28E08_747#Get in there.
S28E08_749#Ralph.
S28E08_751#Yay! I'm a touchdown.
S28E08_756#Look who's a greasy guy!
S28E08_759#Now you're greasy, too!
S28E08_761#Look at you. ?
S28E08_766#Well, hello, Tony Stark.
S28E08_769#We've never had fun like that in my whole life.
S28E08_771#Oh, look! The engine block pizza is almost done.
S28E08_775#Engine block pizza?
S28E08_777#Car food is our thing.
S28E08_778#Careful you don't burn your mouth.
S28E08_780#Oh. He never warns me.
S28E08_784#Vijay Singh has chosen a seven iron for his approach here
S28E08_787#at the Fifth on St Andrews.
S28E08_791#My zombies have got you now.
S28E08_795#What's the matter? Aren't you into the game?
S28E08_797#Uh, yeah, yeah.
S28E08_805#Good luck with that zombie Bing Crosby!
S28E08_807#B-B-Brains.
S28E08_813#I won.
S28E08_815#Huh? Didn't seem like you were too excited
S28E08_816#when you sliced me in half.
S28E08_818#It's just hard when you think you're gonna be slicing
S28E08_820#the same boy in half all your life.
S28E08_824#Well, I guess I'd better get to work.
S28E08_827#On a Friday?
S28E08_831#Why are you wearing a fishing hat?
S28E08_833#Are you going fishing without me?
S28E08_836#What is happening with us?
S28E08_838#If you've got something to say, just say it.
S28E08_841#Unless it's boring.
S28E08_843#Is there someone else?
S28E08_845#Oh! Spare me your melodramata!
S28E08_861#Marge, I can't have a baby.
S28E08_863#Coordinating our sleep schedules will be a nightmare.
S28E08_867#Plus, the only good relationship I ever had was with my hat.
S28E08_870#Then the wind blew it away.
S28E08_872#You didn't have a good relationship with your father?
S28E08_878#Come here, sweet pea, give me a burp.
S28E08_879#Youse can do it.
S28E08_883#Aah! Youse got milk on me!
S28E08_885#I'll murdalize ya!
S28E08_894#That was before throwin' your baby into the sun
S28E08_897#was considered child abuse.
S28E08_900#So you see, Simpson men just don't...
S28E08_902#Wait a minute!
S28E08_907#Now yank the hook out and throw him back
S28E08_910#because we're humane.
S28E08_917#I've never seen Homer and Bart so close.
S28E08_921#Maybe I can finally be a good dad!
S28E08_923#That's not Bart.
S28E08_925#Don't ruin my epiphany!
S28E08_929#?Hey, Mr. Van Houten.
S28E08_931#- Oh, hey, Bart. Milhouse isn't here. - ?I know.
S28E08_932#And I don't care.
S28E08_934#Are you making envelope soup?
S28E08_937#Envelope soup?
S28E08_939#That'd be silly.
S28E08_941#No, I'm stamp mining.
S28E08_943#You steam off the stamp, color in the postmark,
S28E08_946#and you just made half a dollar. Almost.
S28E08_947#Want to try?
S28E08_952#Careful! That's a forever stamp!
S28E08_954#Could be worth a fortune some day.
S28E08_956#Well done.
S28E08_957#And look at me.
S28E08_959#I'm hangin' out with Bart Simpson.
S28E08_961#That's so cool.
S28E08_963#I can't wait till Wendell sees us hangin' out.
S28E08_969#I built it up too much.
S28E08_973#*What do you do with a drunken Homer*
S28E08_975#*Make him watch "Hunt for Red October"*
S28E08_977#*Let him drive in a lunar rover*
S28E08_978#*Tickle his nose with a...*
S28E08_979#Oh, hi, Marge.
S28E08_981#Homer, why were you fishing with Milhouse?
S28E08_984#Because for once, I'm with a kid who respects me.
S28E08_987#One who doesn't call me "Homer."
S28E08_989#I didn't know that bothered you.
S28E08_991#It does. A lot.
S28E08_992#Oh, Homer.
S28E08_994#Feels good when you say it.
S28E08_995#Homer.
S28E08_999#Honey, maybe you should talk to Bart.
S28E08_1001#He's just behind that wall.
S28E08_1002#Yeah, Homer!
S28E08_1004#Get your fat ass over here!
S28E08_1005#You see? You see?!
S28E08_1007#It's not bad enough he calls me "Homer."
S28E08_1009#He calls my buttocks "Ass."
S28E08_1011#Hmm. He probably learned that at school.
S28E08_1013#You bet your ass he did.
S28E08_1015#Maybe you and Lisa can talk to him.
S28E08_1017#Lisa and I aren't speaking right now.
S28E08_1020#I can't believe you threw away my Utne Readers!
S28E08_1023#Oh, is that how you pronounce it?
S28E08_1031#For most of my child's life, I'll be gone.
S28E08_1036#When you're cremated, you feel it!
S28E08_1038#Warn everyone!
S28E08_1044#Oh, Abe, hi.
S28E08_1046#I-I was about to call you.
S28E08_1048#- I had an ultrasound today. - But...
S28E08_1051#Does this mean...?
S28E08_1052#Yup, I'm the father.
S28E08_1054#And I thought she was just using me for a beard.
S28E08_1063#I'm so sorry, Abe.
S28E08_1065#Well, I just want to say...
S28E08_1068#Yes! I can't raise my left arm,
S28E08_1070#much less a child!
S28E08_1073#Yippee! Not having kids keeps you young!
S28E08_1076#Oh, I knew you'd come back!

S28E08_1114#Son, I'm so sorry!
S28E08_1116#I'm getting rid of this stupid stop sign
S28E08_1118#before it hurts somebody else!
S28E08_1125#I'm sorry, too, Dad.
S28E08_1127#You called me Dad!
S28E08_1129#There's a first time for everything.
S28E08_1130#Also, a last.
S28E08_1133#Milhouse, I'd be lying if I said riding in a go-cart
S28E08_1136#with Bart Simpson wasn't the highlight of my life,

S28E08_1172#Yeah, well, I have a son-- he lives in Baltimore.
S28E08_1174#What do you want, a parade, Lou?
S28E08_1177#Listen, Maggie-- can I call you Maggie?
S28E08_1179#Is there a way I can get you to put that pacifier down?
S28E08_1182#Oh, don't worry.
S28E08_1184#I'll be here as long as it takes.
S28E08_1187#You know, if you cooperate,
S28E08_1189#I can talk to your mother about a reduced time out.

S28E09_244#Did I ever tell you about the time I was in a big cast?
S28E09_248#It was the Shelbyville Players production of Pippin.
S28E09_250#- Don't worry, Homie. - I went from player
S28E09_252#to ticket taker in one performance!
S28E09_254#There's two ways of...
S28E09_269#You are in my seat.
S28E09_270#Fight! Fight! Fight!
S28E09_272#Asthma, glasses, asthma!
S28E09_280#There's too much violence in rearview mirrors these days.
S28E09_287#Hey, boy,
S28E09_288#want to sign your old man's cast?
S28E09_289#No problemo.
S28E09_293#What does it say?
S28E09_295#Don't worry about it.
S28E09_296#What did you write?
S28E09_298#Sorry. That's between me and everyone who sees it.
S28E09_300#I need to know!
S28E09_302#Begins with F and ends in C-K.
S28E09_305#Why you little!
S28E09_311#Tell me!
S28E09_312#Never!
S28E09_329#Thanks, partner.
S28E09_331#We've balled up all the 13 gauge alpaca.
S28E09_334#Now maybe there's something fun we can do?
S28E09_337#Sure is. A puzzle.
S28E09_338#"Foggy Day in Berlin."
S28E09_340#5,000 pieces.
S28E09_345#Homer, complete the puzzle!
S28E09_347#I'm a married man!
S28E09_349#Fine. If you need me, I'll be in your schpankenbank.
S28E09_353#*We'll meet again*
S28E09_356#Marge, I don't think we should do this puzzle.
S28E09_359#I know. You can't pick up the pieces.
S28E09_362#That's why I've devised a grid system.
S28E09_365#Huh? I'll hold up a piece, and you call out the number
S28E09_368#and letter of the corresponding grid square.
S28E09_370#Uh... I don't know.
S28E09_372#Q 15?
S28E09_374#Sweetie, it's a side piece.
S28E09_376#Q 15's in the middle.
S28E09_378#Right. Q 15 is in the middle.
S28E09_380#Nothing more fun than rules.
S28E09_382#I'll make some tea to help you think.
S28E09_385#Oh, I hate being immobile and numb.
S28E09_387#If only I was free to move.
S28E09_393#If only.
S28E09_397#It's never pleasant to see this kind of activity, Lisa.
S28E09_400#Particularly on a cell phone that is so much nicer
S28E09_402#than the one I own.
S28E09_408#All the fighting seems to start with who sits where on the bus.
S28E09_411#Um, Lisa. You seem to have a handle on the bus problem.
S28E09_414#Why don't you tackle it? But don't think I won't help.
S28E09_416#I'm providing you with a sash.
S28E09_418#Skinner!
S28E09_420#You are asking a six-year-old girl
S28E09_422#to fix this school's problems.
S28E09_423#I'm eight.
S28E09_425#Oh, carry on.
S28E09_428#What do you mean, there's a legal issue with my trapdoor?
S28E09_431#And, uh, as you explain,
S28E09_433#please take two steps back.
S28E09_435#The old trapdoor was perfectly legal.
S28E09_437#It was grandfathered in under the Reagan-era code.
S28E09_440#But once you start renovating it,
S28E09_442#it has to brought up to modern standards.
S28E09_445#And it has to be handicap accessible.
S28E09_448#A wheelchair would never fall through the current opening.
S28E09_449#But that's not a problem!
S28E09_451#I refuse to hire the handicapped.
S28E09_452#That's another issue.
S28E09_454#But for now, we have left ourselves open
S28E09_457#to a lawsuit by Homer Simpson.
S28E09_459#Fine. Smithers, go see this Simpson character
S28E09_462#and trick him into signing a waiver of liability.
S28E09_464#I'll discuss things with the foreman.
S28E09_468#Enrique, mas grande la puerta!
S28E09_472#Look, Homie! We got three pieces together.
S28E09_475#That's a good day's work!
S28E09_477#Why don't we do one of Maggie's puzzles?
S28E09_479#Cow goes in the cow-shaped hole, boom. Next case.
S28E09_482#Hmm, I thought the one good thing about you hurting yourself
S28E09_485#was that we could spend more time together.
S28E09_487#You did?
S28E09_488#Didn't you?
S28E09_490#Oh yeah, sure, of course.
S28E09_492#Only a fool would admit otherwise.
S28E09_501#Mr. Smithers! Come in, come in.
S28E09_505#Oh! Well, there's our tangle-foot! Already on the mend.
S28E09_507#Yeah, right.
S28E09_510#They say it'll be three months before I can scratch my ass.
S28E09_513#Six before I can really go at it.
S28E09_515#Listen, I-I don't want to take up your time.
S28E09_517#I just need Homer's signature on a couple of things.
S28E09_519#First, a get-well card to himself.
S28E09_522#And what else does he need to sign?
S28E09_523#Oh, a...
S28E09_524#...waiver of liability.
S28E09_527#I know, I know.
S28E09_529#There are solid reasons to sue.
S28E09_531#But do you really want to fill your life
S28E09_533#with parasitic attorneys with get-rich-quick schemes?
S28E09_536#Schemes? Rich? Quick?
S28E09_537#Parasitic?
S28E09_540#How could I have forgotten to sue Mr. Burns?
S28E09_542#That's how you get rich in America.
S28E09_544#Sue S.A! Sue S.A!
S28E09_546#Oh, Lord.
S28E09_548#Finally, a chance to use this.
S28E09_552#It was designed ironically, but I would die for it.
S28E09_557#Are you home during the day because you were injured at work, 
S28E09_560#school, museum, church, Iraq, elevator plummet,
S28E09_563#uneven sidewalk, hit by foul ball, hit by fair ball,
S28E09_566#or Iditarod viewing party?
S28E09_567#The first one! The first one you said!
S28E09_569#Call me, Maxwell Flinch, at
S28E09_572#{\an8}555-555-5555.
S28E09_575#Five, five, five...
S28E09_577#Wait, what was the number after the first three fives,
S28E09_578#but before the last six fives?
S28E09_580#Uh, Simpson, before you do anything rash,
S28E09_582#Mr. Burns wanted you to enjoy this get-well cake.
S28E09_585#What's that writing on top? ?Oh!
S28E09_588#It's just, uh, strawberry boilerplate absolving us of liability.
S28E09_591#Now just bite here, here, here,
S28E09_593#nibble here, lick here...
S28E09_595#Uh, your wife needs to eat this cupcake...
S28E09_597#Sir, you cannot bribe me with cake.
S28E09_601#Because I just ate several pies.
S28E09_604#Hello, Mr. Smithers.
S28E09_606#I see you haven't given up.
S28E09_608#Just enjoy the cake. 
S28E09_610#As long as you don't eat it in front of a notary public, you're fine.
S28E09_613#I'm a notary public.
S28E09_615#You gave your ink pad to Maggie.
S28E09_621#I'll, um, I'll walk out with you.
S28E09_623#Don't go yet. You guys can help me
S28E09_625#brainstorm a pattern for my new quilt.
S28E09_627#Marge, I mean this in the nicest way:
S28E09_630#your idea of fun makes me want to blow my brains out.
S28E09_636#Oh, Razzmatazz is perfect, Marge.
S28E09_638#It's-it's uh-- it's red,
S28E09_640#but not, uh, too red.
S28E09_641#You're right!
S28E09_642#Why don't you stick around
S28E09_644#and we'll discuss stitching patterns over tea?
S28E09_646#I'd like that.
S28E09_647#And I'll take the cake back to the home
S28E09_649#and share it with the seniors.
S28E09_650#Typical.
S28E09_651#I'll keep Dad company.
S28E09_653#Thank you, Bart.
S28E09_655#Oh, I dropped it.
S28E09_658#Hey, wha-what did you put down my back?
S28E09_659#Could be a tarantula,
S28E09_661#could just be some yarn.
S28E09_662#I'll be at Milhouse's.
S28E09_671#What the hell?
S28E09_673#Oh, it's such a pleasure to pour tea for someone
S28E09_676#and not have to help him chew it.
S28E09_678#We've made our choices.
S28E09_680#And the world doesn't understand them,
S28E09_681#but we do.
S28E09_690#You know Marge, somehow I feel that more than anyone, 
S28E09_693#you understand those horrible words, "What do you see in him?"
S28E09_696#I never said this,
S28E09_698#but did you ever think we cling to these guys
S28E09_701#because we're afraid to admit we were wrong?
S28E09_703#Do you really think that?
S28E09_705#Well, I've tried to use it constructively.
S28E09_710#I try to have "The serenity
S28E09_712#to accept the things I cannot change
S28E09_714#and the courage to change the things I can."
S28E09_715#That's what they said to me
S28E09_717#at that Alcoholics Unanimous meeting!
S28E09_720#Attention, bus riders!
S28E09_722#My new seating plan avoids conflict
S28E09_725#through the use of complex social algorithms.
S28E09_728#It teams up compatible seatmates
S28E09_730#and places Milhouse with no one.
S28E09_732#Yet somehow, I'm still a little scared.
S28E09_735#Otto, why are you sitting in back?
S28E09_737#Waiting for my assignment, chief.
S28E09_739#The driver's seat. You're the driver.
S28E09_741#Still me?
S28E09_743#New management, same mistakes.
S28E09_748#It's so quiet. I've never been able to hear my music before.
S28E09_753#Ooh, it sucks.
S28E09_756#This is just the beginning.
S28E09_758#Soon I'll have control over every aspect of their lives.
S28E09_762#And then I'll make them achieve their un-dreamt dreams.
S28E09_765#Sherri next to Terri.
S28E09_767#Jimbo next to Dolph.
S28E09_769#No one next to Milhouse.
S28E09_771#Ralph next to his invisible friend.
S28E09_773#Kearney next to Nelson.
S28E09_774#Martin next to Wendell.
S28E09_776#Cosine next to Database.
S28E09_782#My first PG-13 fantasy.
S28E09_784#Since we haven't been able to get a settlement,
S28E09_786#we'll have to start preparing you for your deposition.
S28E09_788#Caroline here will stand in for the opposing attorney.
S28E09_791#Good afternoon, Mr. Burns.
S28E09_793#Release the hounds.
S28E09_795#Uh, sir, you should try to project a friendlier demeanor.
S28E09_798#Release the hounds.
S28E09_800#Please.
S28E09_802#Seriously, sir, it would really be wise
S28E09_803#not to mention the hounds.
S28E09_805#Oh, that's like telling Three-Finger Brown
S28E09_807#he can't play for the Brooklyn Tip-Tops.
S28E09_811#Waylon, now I can see 
S28E09_813#why so many women in movies have gay friends.
S28E09_816#Like Princess Leia and C-3PO.
S28E09_819#Listen, I made this for you.
S28E09_821#Oh, my God.
S28E09_823#No one ever gives me a gift. Thank you.
S28E09_826#No one ever tells me thank you.
S28E09_828#I think you see my true self.
S28E09_831#The one I never pay attention to at all.
S28E09_834#Oh, my God. I want to kiss him.
S28E09_836#Oh, my God. She wants to kiss me.
S28E09_837#I'm a married woman. 
S28E09_839#She would look good with a mustache.
S28E09_849#Uh, I've got to go.
S28E09_854#Thank God I've got a husband with benefits.
S28E09_857#Come here, you.
S28E09_858#Okay, but...
S28E09_873#Smithers.
S28E09_874#Wait a sec.
S28E09_877#Marge is getting her emotional needs fulfilled by another man,
S28E09_880#and now she needs me for nothing but sex.
S28E09_883#I'm the luckiest husband in the world!
S28E09_888#You haven't gotten that stupid signature yet?
S28E09_890#No.
S28E09_892#And I'm not sure I want to.
S28E09_893#You defy me?
S28E09_895#Smithers, pour me a glass of water.
S28E09_901#Now squeeze my chest.
S28E09_904#Now, either get that signature 
S28E09_906#or you're in charge of restarting our plant at Chernobyl.
S28E09_908#That was us?
S28E09_910#That doesn't leave this room.
S28E09_913#Well brother, prepare to enjoy another day
S28E09_916#of calm, peaceful behavior on the school bus.
S28E09_918#I got to warn you, 
S28E09_920#a lot of kids are pretty unhappy with the required seating.
S28E09_925#Well, they'll be happy when I also organize cafeteria seating, 
S28E09_928#who's picked for teams,
S28E09_930#and I've divided the playground into swingers and pushers.
S28E09_932#That's insane.
S28E09_934#You just bought yourself a year of pushing.
S28E09_948#Order. Order. Maintain order.
S28E09_951#Tunnel.
S28E09_976#This message couldn't be clearer.
S28E09_978#The children need more sauce on their spaghetti.
S28E09_980#Also, their spelling is atrocious.
S28E09_984#Well, at least I have my photos.
S28E09_990#I thought I had made things better.
S28E09_992#Lisa, the bus is supposed to be crazy.
S28E09_995#It's the brief respite between the twin nightmares
S28E09_997#of home and school.
S28E09_999#The one thing a know-it-all doesn't know
S28E09_1001#is that everyone hates a know-it-all.
S28E09_1004#Did we, uh, lose anyone?
S28E09_1006#Just the police chief's son.
S28E09_1011#I bit a rat.
S28E09_1015#Marge, this is the last time I'm coming by.
S28E09_1018#Oh. Well, that's fine.
S28E09_1020#I mean, I do have my knitting to get to.
S28E09_1024#I'm going to a living hell followed by a certain death.
S28E09_1027#Here's a picture to remember me by.
S28E09_1029#Taken by my grandma from her deathbed.
S28E09_1031#The last thing she saw.
S28E09_1039#What's wrong, honey?
S28E09_1041#Oh, I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to.
S28E09_1044#I appreciate that, and I'd like to talk.
S28E09_1047#I'm just so drained after all the time I spend with the kids.
S28E09_1049#What time?
S28E09_1051#I took you to that colonial village.
S28E09_1053#That was a pub at the airport.
S28E09_1055#I had an ale. You sat on a barrel. That makes it colonial.
S28E09_1058#Homer, I'm sorry, you have to understand.
S28E09_1061#Without Waylon to talk to, I feel completely alone.
S28E09_1064#I totally get it.
S28E09_1066#One question: who's Waylon?
S28E09_1067#Smithers.
S28E09_1068#Totally get it.
S28E09_1071#Oh, my wife really needs something and to get it
S28E09_1073#I may have to forego my settlement.
S28E09_1075#Homer, you fell down a trapdoor into a cement mixer.
S28E09_1078#Don't you think I deserve something for that?
S28E09_1080#I'm just trying to do what's right.
S28E09_1082#Then why did you file a lawsuit?
S28E09_1086#I really think you should change the venue, sir.
S28E09_1088#You can't win a case in this town.
S28E09_1090#Oh, are they still mad about me eating the town panda?
S28E09_1092#Get over it.
S28E09_1096#Wait, wait, wait, wait.
S28E09_1099#I'm willing to sign anything you want on one condition.
S28E09_1101#Fine. What's your condition?
S28E09_1103#You have to keep Mr. Smithers here.
S28E09_1106#I see. And are you fool enough
S28E09_1108#to believe a man's handshake means anything?
S28E09_1110#I am.
S28E09_1111#Well, put 'er there.
S28E09_1113#Homer, no!
S28E09_1115#Why doesn't anyone ever think of the lawyer?
S28E09_1118#Aw, if I do a slip 'n' fall on the courthouse steps,
S28E09_1120#would that help?
S28E09_1122#It might.
S28E09_1127#See you Thursday.
S28E09_1129#And I'll see you Thursday night.
S28E09_1133#And I'll see you early Friday morning.
S28E09_1139#Oh, these slippery stairs.
S28E09_1143#Homie!
S28E09_1144#Marge, no!
S28E09_1152#Marge,
S28E09_1153#I know Smithers was good at talking to you.
S28E09_1156#And I want to talk to you too.
S28E09_1159#Just don't expect me to be great at first.
S28E09_1165#Oh, honey, no one's great their first time.
S28E09_1168#It's like baking.
S28E09_1170#Uh, okay, well, uh...
S28E09_1171#I like you.
S28E09_1173#And I adore you.
S28E09_1176#You sacrificed yourself for my happiness.
S28E09_1179#There is nothing that makes a woman
S28E09_1181#feel more cherished and secure.
S28E09_1183#Thank you, my darling.
S28E09_1185#Marge, this is going great.
S28E09_1188#Now don't you worry, I made you both soup.
S28E09_1192#Ooh-hoo, it's pipin' hot.
S28E09_1194#Two hours in the microwave.
S28E09_1202#Who knows what the "D.C." stands for in Washington, D.C.? 
S28E09_1204#Anyone?
S28E09_1205#Anyone?
S28E09_1207#Mustn't be a know-it-all.
S28E09_1208#Never again. Not worth it.
S28E09_1210#D.C. Anyone?
S28E09_1212#Daddy's kitchen?
S28E09_1215#Not quite. Anyone else?
S28E09_1216#No? Okay.
S28E09_1219#Children, "D.C." stands for "District of the Capitol."
S28E09_1222#No it doesn't!
S28E09_1224#The answer is "District of Columbia."
S28E09_1226#And Miss Hoover, I don't want to be a smarty pants,
S28E09_1228#but the previous answer was Texas.
S28E09_1230#Before that, 1848.
S28E09_1232#Before that, Seward's Folly.
S28E09_1234#And your dentist appointment is not tomorrow,
S28E09_1236#it's the day after. Thank you.
S28E10_82#the Patriarch.
S28E10_84#Actually, Parson, we all have the same boss.
S28E10_87#The Metropolitan.
S28E10_89#And it is his will that we come together here for...
S28E10_92#a divine intervention.
S28E10_95#Look, since when is it a crime
S28E10_97#to mix Pinot Noir and Vicodin?
S28E10_99#Oh, we don't care if you wreck your liver
S28E10_101#with Sancerre and acetaminophen.
S28E10_104#You can pop pain pills like cran-raisins for all we care.
S28E10_108#We're here 'cause you're not packing the p-p-p-pews.
S28E10_111#The church is emptier than a syrup bottle

S28E10_115#Oh, people have reasons to miss mass.
S28E10_117#There's flu going around, the new Jeeps are in at the dealership.
S28E10_121#Lot of new features, the big screen up front, where...
S28E10_123#It's not just attendance, Reverend.
S28E10_125#It's that sometimes when you speak, my mind wanders,
S28E10_128#to, uh, non-religious areas.
S28E10_134#Timothy, admit it. You're in a slump.
S28E10_136#How many souls have you personally converted
S28E10_138#to our faith this year?
S28E10_140#Negative six.
S28E10_142#You have some converting to do.
S28E10_146#I haven't been heard from!
S28E10_148#And what do you have to say?
S28E10_149#Nothing!
S28E10_151#Just pointing it out.
S28E10_154#Okay, I can do this.
S28E10_155#I'm a good man.
S28E10_158#And Springfield is nothing if not a good Christian community.
S28E10_169#I'm worried about this festival.
S28E10_171#It's like something you'd see in a college town. ?
S28E10_173#Come on, Mom,
S28E10_175#get with the pagan agenda.
S28E10_177#This doggy likes me.
S28E10_180#Don't worry, Ralphie, I'll shoot you off of there.
S28E10_184#Come on guys, let's go check out
S28E10_186#this year's feature attraction:
S28E10_187#the Strandbeest.
S28E10_190#Powered by the wind!
S28E10_193#Is this science, or garbage?
S28E10_195#Dutch art. ?
S28E10_198#And I'll bet it's environmentally conscious.
S28E10_200#No. It is not.
S28E10_205#It's alive!
S28E10_211#The wind is picking up slightly.
S28E10_212#This is a disaster!
S28E10_214#The Beest is built for the polite breezes of Europe.
S28E10_218#Save me, Odin.
S28E10_221#Look, Dad, I can skate backwards!
S28E10_224#Great, Sophie! Just watch out for Strandbeests!
S28E10_238#What the...?
S28E10_243#Okay, I got to warn ya.
S28E10_245#Regular morphine doesn't work on me anymore.
S28E10_247#Call this number and they'll send the stuff I need.
S28E10_250#It'll say "For elephants," but ignore that.
S28E10_254#Sorry about this, Sophie.
S28E10_256#Couldn't have come at a worse time.
S28E10_258#I only get one week of custody, once a year.
S28E10_261#It's okay, Dad. We'll get to know each other
S28E10_263#in this semi-private room.
S28E10_265#Oh, I'll give you all the privacy you need.
S28E10_271#Harold?
S28E10_272#Private room!
S28E10_278#So,
S28E10_280#uh, how's your act coming along?
S28E10_282#I'm not in show business.
S28E10_284#What kind of a screwed-up kid are you?
S28E10_286#I'm not screwed up. I get good grades.
S28E10_288#I play the French horn.
S28E10_289#Good, good.
S28E10_291#You know, it's funny when someone's playing it
S28E10_292#and their pants fall down.
S28E10_294#I haven't had that happen.
S28E10_296#Well, don't feel bad.
S28E10_298#It's actually a pretty complicated rig.
S28E10_300#The whole megillah is a big tzimmes.
S28E10_302#Tzimmes? Megillah?
S28E10_303#It's Yiddish.
S28E10_305#The language of our fakakta people.
S28E10_308#Mom raised me Christian.
S28E10_309#A Christian?
S28E10_312#That farbissina shiksa.
S28E10_314#How can you ignore the sacred traditions
S28E10_316#of the Jewish people?
S28E10_319#Krusty, here's your bacon, lobster and tref sandwich.
S28E10_322#Hey, it was supposed to come with a side of camel.
S28E10_324#Extra cloven.
S28E10_326#Dad, you don't have to be sort of funny with me.
S28E10_329#The thing is, I want to celebrate this time with you.
S28E10_332#Sweetie, I know you're reaching out.
S28E10_335#But to me, Christmas is just another day.
S28E10_339#I usually curl up with a good bookmaker, and...
S28E10_341#Well...
S28E10_345#Why don't the two of you spend Christmas with us?
S28E10_349#Our home isn't fancy, but we'd love to set a place for two more.
S28E10_353#Marge, we accept.
S28E10_355#Can we bring anything?
S28E10_356#Just yourself.
S28E10_357#That'll cost you.
S28E10_360#Oh, Maggie.
S28E10_362#Guess who just came down the chimney?
S28E10_364#A magical holiday friend,
S28E10_366#straight from the North Pole.
S28E10_369#He's called the Gnome In Your Home, and he works for Santa,
S28E10_372#by watching you all the time.
S28E10_375#According to a book sold separately,
S28E10_378#the Gnome In Your Home doesn't need food or sleep.
S28E10_381#He lives for just one thing:
S28E10_383#to tell Santa if you're bad or good.
S28E10_387#He's gonna live here on your shelf,
S28E10_389#and he never shuts his eyes.
S28E10_391#Isn't that cute?
S28E10_392#You'd better be good,
S28E10_394#or he'll nibble your wittle fingers!
S28E10_408#Oh, boy, Krusty's here!
S28E10_412#A very merry Christmas,
S28E10_414#from the bottom of my heart.
S28E10_417#Did you get the shot?
S28E10_419#How did it play? Was I too sincere?
S28E10_420#Perfect, Mr. K!
S28E10_422#Start laying dolly track.
S28E10_428#Come on, damn it!
S28E10_430#Christmas is about one thing:
S28E10_432#being with family.
S28E10_434#Sophie, come sit on Daddy's lap.
S28E10_436#I don't want to be on camera.
S28E10_438#Fine, we'll just motion-capture her in later.
S28E10_447#That's my girl.
S28E10_450#Oh, what a beautiful gingerbread house.
S28E10_452#Wish I could make one.
S28E10_455#And I can! On a multi-function Minolta printer.
S28E10_458#Print, scan, copy,
S28E10_460#let Minolta do your Xeroxing!
S28E10_464#"...when what to my wondering yes did appear..."
S28E10_467#To hear me read the rest of this poem,
S28E10_469#dial 1-900-OLD-POEM.
S28E10_471#$9.95 per call.
S28E10_473#All I wanted was to spend the holidays with you
S28E10_475#so we could learn more about each other.
S28E10_477#Well, I learned!
S28E10_479#Get out!
S28E10_482#?What? Seriously?
S28E10_484#You really want me to go?
S28E10_485#Yes.
S28E10_487#Right now.
S28E10_495#Uh, can we get some room tone?
S28E10_496#Just 20 seconds.
S28E10_509#Oh, Sophie! Please, forgive me.
S28E10_511#I canceled the show.
S28E10_513#I'm pulling up duct tape myself,
S28E10_515#like a caveman!
S28E10_519#Just leave me alone.
S28E10_525#If the Word of God isn't enough,
S28E10_527#I also have some rubber jar openers.
S28E10_531#I've been directing Christmas pageants for 30 years.
S28E10_533#There's no way there's a God.
S28E10_535#Forget it. 
S28E10_537#Our nonsense is so much better than your nonsense.
S28E10_539#Look at this guy! He can be a Pixar hero.
S28E10_541#Look at him!
S28E10_544#No, maybe I'm just not cut out for the God game.
S28E10_547#Maybe I could teach S.A.T. Prep.
S28E10_549#At least there are answers in the back of that book.
S28E10_558#What kind of poison do you serve to a guy
S28E10_561#whose daughter hates his guts?
S28E10_563#Yeah. Try a Duff Numb. No flavor, just alcohol.
S28E10_568#I need something that makes me feel better in my heart.
S28E10_571#Like firing a writer.
S28E10_573#Especially one who just bought a house.
S28E10_578#My son, I'm here to guide you to the most powerful man
S28E10_581#in this world, or any other.
S28E10_583#J.J. Abrams?
S28E10_585#No. Jesus.
S28E10_588#He is reaching his arms out to you.
S28E10_591#Oh, my God.
S28E10_592#I can see him.
S28E10_594#I am a Christian!
S28E10_601#Uh, Chief, I think you got him.
S28E10_603#Yeah, it's Christmas.
S28E10_605#Just bang his head on the car door and we'll call it a day.
S28E10_607#Merry Christmas. ?
S28E10_609#Good night, sweet Maggie.
S28E10_612#Why are you huddling over there?
S28E10_613#The gnome can't see you.
S28E10_615#I'll move your crib closer.
S28E10_619#There.
S28E10_630#Oh, sorry, I forgot your nightlight.
S28E10_633#The gnome can't nibble your fingers
S28E10_636#if he can't see them.
S28E10_641#Hey, Maggie.
S28E10_643#I thought I'd try the violin.
S28E10_663#I've got a tummy ache.
S28E10_666#Maybe I ate too much before bedtime.
S28E10_674#Have you been a bad baby?
S28E10_678#Don't lie to me...
S28E10_680#or Christmas morning will never come!
S28E10_700#Oh, don't worry, Maggie.
S28E10_703#He can't beat the super team of Santa, Jack Frost,
S28E10_707#the Abominable Snowman and Wayne Gretzky.
S28E10_710#He's got a gun.
S28E10_733#Merry Christmas, Maggie!
S28E10_738#Was Maggie a good little girl?
S28E10_740#She was?!
S28E10_743#Well, you did such a good job, Mr. Gnome,
S28E10_746#that we're gonna leave you here all year round.
S28E10_761#"...which they also did and sent to the elders
S28E10_763#by the hands of Barnabas and Saul."
S28E10_766#Now, I'd like to introduce our newest brother in faith:
S28E10_769#Krusty the Christian.
S28E10_772#*Amazing grace*
S28E10_775#*How sweet the sound*
S28E10_778#*That saved a putz*
S28E10_781#*Like me.*
S28E10_785#Aw, I remember the day she came into my life.
S28E10_793#Here's a present for Maggie.
S28E10_799#And the good news is, Spycraft Toys makes other invasive dolls
S28E10_801#Narc In The Park,
S28E10_802#Bear Who's Always There
S28E10_804#and Snoop While You Poop.
S28E10_805#Won't that be fun?
S28E10_806#So much fun.
S28E10_815#Oh, now sweetie, that's a present for your mother.
S28E10_818#Another Christmas in the bag.
S28E10_820#I love my juicer.
S28E10_824#And don't worry, Marge, I'm adding fruit.
S28E10_829#You know,
S28E10_831#I might have one more present for you.
S28E10_841#What is it?
S28E10_842#What is it?!
S28E10_844#What the...?!
S28E10_855#Welcome to the Krusty the Clown Sober Contemplation Hour.
S28E10_859#Pray, pray, kids.
S28E10_861#We've got a very uplifting show today.
S28E10_863#He is risen.
S28E10_865#And now please silently reflect
S28E10_868#upon the wholesome new teachings of Itchy and Scratchy.
S28E10_871#*They pray, they pray*
S28E10_873#*They pray and they don't slay*
S28E10_875#*Pray, pray, pray, they found a way*
S28E10_878#*The pious mouse and cat.*
S28E10_886#They shall beat their swords into plowshares.
S28E10_889#I think it's about time we put on some clothes.
S28E10_894#And then this happened.
S28E10_897#Wow, Dad, you wrecked your entire show
S28E10_899#just to prove you love me.
S28E10_901#Wait a minute, wait a minute.
S28E10_902#Here comes a cream pie.
S28E10_911#Coming up next, we've got some hilarious comedians.
S28E10_913#Finally.
S28E10_915#Andrew Nice Clay,
S28E10_916#Larry the Fable Guy
S28E10_918#and Joe Piscopalian.
S28E10_920#Oh, if he was gonna convert,
S28E10_922#why didn't he pick a funny religion?
S28E10_924#Like Zoroastrianism.
S28E10_926#Their top god is named Mazda.
S28E10_928#Tell me that's not hilarious.
S28E10_931#And now the moment you've been waiting for...
S28E10_935#The nature of the universe is we are forced to wait for every moment.
S28E10_938#As Mazda teaches us...
S28E10_940#My daughter will play the French horn
S28E10_943#and no one's pants will drop.
S28E10_951#I guess this will just be for me.
S28E10_957#Well, look at you, all cool and collected.
S28E10_959#Oh, well, even the Lord rested on Sunday.
S28E10_962#But Krusty's not ours till he's b-b-b-baptized.
S28E10_966#You have to get his soul and his bank router number on autopay.
S28E10_969#Oh, he wanted to do it the old-fashioned way,
S28E10_972#in the river with Miss Teenage Nevada,
S28E10_974#but the river's frozen.
S28E10_976#I have to wait until the ice melts.
S28E10_979#I had you pegged for a closer, Tim.
S28E10_981#You know, Ogdenville is looking for a prison chaplain.
S28E10_984#The last one, well...
S28E10_986#he got a very cool tattoo...
S28E10_988#that he didn't ask for.
S28E10_993#*Gather with the saints*
S28E10_995#*At the river*
S28E10_1000#*That flows by the throne of God*
S28E10_1004#*Throne of God*
S28E10_1009#Will the baptismal candidate please approach?
S28E10_1013#You're sure you want to do this, Dad?
S28E10_1014#Seems kind of meshugana.
S28E10_1016#I want to be a total Christian for you, babe,
S28E10_1019#so I'm gonna shpritz my tuchis...
S28E10_1021#Be careful of the current.
S28E10_1023#Don't worry, I haven't been current in years.
S28E10_1040#Oh, great, my death is a hacky parody of Frozen.
S28E10_1044#Dad? But who's the moose?
S28E10_1046#I'm your first agent.
S28E10_1048#Oh, this is the most we've ever spoken.
S28E10_1053#I must be dead.
S28E10_1054#You're not dead yet.
S28E10_1056#Listen, I should know because I am.
S28E10_1058#And life was no picnic, but let me tell you,
S28E10_1060#death is no picnic, either.
S28E10_1062#Your biggest mistake is expecting picnics.
S28E10_1064#Dad!
S28E10_1066#Oh, I suppose you're not happy that I'm converting.
S28E10_1070#Herschel, your heart just stopped so I'll make this very quick.
S28E10_1073#There's no one religion that makes you a good father.
S28E10_1076#All you got to do is think of your children
S28E10_1078#before yourself, that's all...
S28E10_1080#except with those oxygen masks that you get on the planes.
S28E10_1082#There it's vice-a-versa.
S28E10_1084#Well, I guess you would know.
S28E10_1086#You're a rabbi who's seen the face of God.
S28E10_1089#Actually, I'm a hallucination caused by cell death
S28E10_1091#in your suffocating brain.
S28E10_1093#Also, I saw you texting during my funeral.
S28E10_1096#For shame! ?
S28E10_1099#Oh, reel him in.
S28E10_1101#You've caught a drowning man!
S28E10_1102#Slow down.
S28E10_1104#First I'm gonna play him a little.
S28E10_1110#"I shall be a fisher of men."
S28E10_1120#I'm alive!
S28E10_1122#Don't tell my ex-wife.
S28E10_1128#Lovejoy is a hero!
S28E10_1130#Finally something I can explain!
S28E10_1133#*All ended well except for Sideshow Mel*
S28E10_1135#*This Jewish clown, he didn't drown*
S28E10_1138#*Reconciled with his daughter*
S28E10_1140#*When he got out of the water*
S28E10_1142#*Here's the good news, butts in the pews*
S28E10_1144#*Watch Homer snooze as he still chews*
S28E10_1146#*Our show is almost done*
S28E10_1147#*Maggie didn't stop*
S28E10_1149#*At one*
S28E10_1157#Sorry about Krusty, but he's still on Team Hanukkah.
S28E10_1160#Um, I hate to win on a technicality,
S28E10_1163#but he was under the water.
S28E10_1165#That's a baptism.
S28E10_1167#Maybe we should ask Mazda?
S28E10_1169#I'm not going to ask him anything, he's drunk.
S28E10_1172#Oh, and like you're not!
S28E10_1184#*Just hear those sleigh bells jingling*
S28E10_1186#*Ring-ting-tingling along*

S30E01_47#If you like that cello so much, why don't you marry it?

S30E01_101#Please. I love you.
S30E01_104#I'm not doing it. I'm refusing a dare.

S30E01_141#Dad, do you think I did the right thing?
S30E01_144#Of course, absolutely.
S30E01_146#You did the worst thing any boy can do.
S30E01_148#It's worse than wetting your pants while on Santa's lap,
S30E01_151#and I've been on both sides of that one.
S30E01_152#I'm sorry.
S30E01_154#Bart, you have to take a dare.
S30E01_157#- B-B-But what if it's...? - Any dare.
S30E01_160#Grampa, Dad says I have to take a dare.
S30E01_162#I had Homer on a dare,
S30E01_164#and as horrible as that worked out, I'd do that again.
S30E01_167#Why did someone dare you to have Homer?
S30E01_169#It was after the war; we needed babies.
S30E01_171#Bart, I have a secret.
S30E01_173#I've never been happier to be your mother.
S30E01_176#You're a good boy.
S30E01_178#Mom, please. Somebody might hear you.
S30E01_185#Oh, look at him!
S30E01_187#Ha-ha. Bart's mom wears a seat belt.
S30E01_191#Let them laugh, Bart.
S30E01_193#This is wonderful.
S30E01_196#Every laugh turns into one more smoochie-poo from Mom.
S30E01_200#Cut it out.
S30E01_204#Three cheers for the mama's boys.
S30E01_206#Sorry to do this on Mother's Day!
S30E01_214#So, Simpson, word on the street
S30E01_216#is you're looking for a dare.
S30E01_217#Yeah, fine.
S30E01_219#I need to get this monkey off my back.
S30E01_222#Hey, how about that for a dare?
S30E01_223#Putting a monkey on his back.
S30E01_225#And after we're done, then what?
S30E01_227#We have a monkey that's our permanent responsibility.
S30E01_230#Yeah, think ahead, dingus.
S30E01_233#Simpson, I dare you to jump into the reservoir
S30E01_236#from Dead Boy's Ledge.
S30E01_238#We'll be watching from Haw-Haw Heights.
S30E01_244#Simpson, is that your kid?
S30E01_246#Oh, my God. I've got to stop him!
S30E01_247#I dare you not to.
S30E01_251#It was a joke, idiot. Get your kid.
S30E01_254#Bart!
S30E01_256#Do I really have to do this?
S30E01_257#I dare you.
S30E01_259#Dare you. Dare you.
S30E01_260#Dare you.
S30E01_262#I love Echo Canyon.
S30E01_264#Oh, this place sure has a lot of names.
S30E01_267#Cowabunga!
S30E01_271#We've done all we could.
S30E01_272#Run!
S30E01_273#Beat it!
S30E01_277#He'll be fine.
S30E01_279#And my burrito's ready.
S30E01_283#Your boy should wake up soon.
S30E01_286#All right. This time, he's really done it.
S30E01_288#We're gonna have to do something.
S30E01_290#Change schools. Move.
S30E01_292#Whatever it takes.
S30E01_293#Mom?
S30E01_295#- Sweetie, are you okay? - I am.
S30E01_299#Then why would you do such a stupid, stupid thing?
S30E01_302#Marge, Marge. As someone who's fallen off
S30E01_304#a cliff multiple times,
S30E01_305#the best thing we can do
S30E01_307#is teach him how to fall off cliffs.
S30E01_310#I just want to know, Bart.
S30E01_312#I had hope and now I don't. Why?
S30E01_316#Please, O Lord.
S30E01_318#Let him think of an awesome lie.
S30E01_321#Well, when I was in the other world...
S30E01_324#What other world?
S30E01_326#I'm not sure.
S30E01_328#But it was joyful, clouds, harps,
S30E01_331#Abe Lincoln.
S30E01_332#Oh, my God, Marge!
S30E01_334#I think our son went to heaven.
S30E01_336#Were there any other presidents?
S30E01_337#No.
S30E01_338#It was heaven. What else, boy?
S30E01_340#I have a message for you, Mom.
S30E01_341#- From who? - Jesus.
S30E01_343#Don't say that if it's not true.
S30E01_345#You have to believe him, Marge.
S30E01_347#It's a deathbed confession.
S30E01_349#He's not on his deathbed.
S30E01_351#The guy in the bed before him died.
S30E01_354#Mom. Jesus said to tell you, "Things will get better."
S30E01_357#Oh, I really want to believe that.
S30E01_360#If you saw Jesus, did you see anything else?
S30E01_363#I saw your dad, Grandpa Bouvier.
S30E01_365#Tell me something he said that only I would know.
S30E01_367#He said...
S30E01_370#he thinks Homer is an idiot.
S30E01_372#Oh, my God, I can hear his voice through you.
S30E01_375#Excuse me a minute.
S30E01_377#Good work, boy.
S30E01_379#You got us off the hook in the short term,
S30E01_381#which is all that ever matters.
S30E01_387#Tell me more about heaven, son.
S30E01_388#Jesus rides a rainbow horse.
S30E01_390#Fascinating. Is the horse rainbow-colored?
S30E01_393#Or does it walk on a rainbow?
S30E01_396#Rainbows come out its butt.
S30E01_398#Let me ponder that with joy.
S30E01_400#Tell me more, son.
S30E01_402#Well, there's no cracks on the sidewalks.
S30E01_404#And saying you brushed your teeth makes it true.
S30E01_408#You can go to baseball games with all the dead players.
S30E01_411#And you always catch a home run.
S30E01_413#And the angels talk to each other like this:
S30E01_416#Does this... Jesus have any tattoos?
S30E01_419#or distinguishing marks?
S30E01_422#No, but he really thinks the sermons are too long.
S30E01_425#Boys, we're gonna have a talk with the Reverend.
S30E01_432#Bart.
S30E01_433#I've held my tongue,
S30E01_435#because I appreciate you not ruining my song.
S30E01_437#Can't ruin what already sucks. Burn.
S30E01_441#All right. I'm just gonna say it.
S30E01_443#I don't think you really saw Jesus.
S30E01_444#You know, the Lord warned me
S30E01_446#there'd be disbelievers. Begone!
S30E01_449#I don't know why you're doing this,
S30E01_451#but beware, little lies lead to big lies.
S30E01_454#And big lies get punished.
S30E01_458#That's the Devil ringing that bell.
S30E01_460#Are you gonna answer?
S30E01_462#Hey, don't think you can scare the boy who died
S30E01_463#and went to heaven.
S30E01_465#Get the door.
S30E01_467#Hey, cut it out.
S30E01_470#Oh, no, it's stuck.
S30E01_472#Hello, Bart.
S30E01_474#We are Christian movie producers.
S30E01_477#So... you give all your profits back to the church?
S30E01_483#You... uh... Could you, uh, uh...
S30E01_485#Could you get your dad?
S30E01_487#Homer, we're the best in the business.
S30E01_490#Our films average 98% on Rotten Communion Wafers.
S30E01_494#Now, we'd like to tell your son's story.
S30E01_497#You want to make a movie out of what happened to Bart?
S30E01_499#Well, absolutely.
S30E01_501#Unless it's not true.
S30E01_504#Okay, I could admit the boy totally lied
S30E01_508#or I could make a movie inspired by true events.
S30E01_514#Brother Homer, why do you hesitate?
S30E01_517#I hesitate because I am stunned
S30E01_520#that you doubt the Word of God!
S30E01_522#Then we have a deal.
S30E01_523#Not so fast.
S30E01_525#Like most of America, I think I know the movie business.
S30E01_528#Please. What would you like?
S30E01_530#I want input on the script.
S30E01_532#I want two seats to the premiere.
S30E01_534#And my wife needs a seat as well.
S30E01_536#And I'm not thanking the Georgia Film Commission,
S30E01_538#no matter what.
S30E01_540#We will need to pray on this, Brother Homer.
S30E01_542#Of course. So will we.
S30E01_544#Kneel down, boy.
S30E01_545#What for?
S30E01_548#Because we're going to pray like we often do.
S30E01_553#Heavenly God, who art in heaven, holler out your name.
S30E01_556#Thy Kingdom come. I'm almost done.
S30E01_559#Can this square join your circle?
S30E01_561#Absotively-posilutely.
S30E01_563#In that same spirit, I'm glad to hear it.
S30E01_565#- Oh, hi-diddly-do. - A-dum-dum-diddly. - Diddly-doodly, brother.
S30E01_567#- Diddly-doodly-diddly-dice. - Diddly. Diddly.
S30E01_568#- Nice to diddly meet you. - Brotherino.
S30E01_571#I heard movie meetings were horrible, but I had no idea.
S30E01_574#Well, perhaps you could write
S30E01_576#the screenplay with Brother Homer.
S30E01_578#I don't think so.
S30E01_579#Wait, wait, wait.
S30E01_581#I'm being filled with the spirit of Jesus.
S30E01_584#Oh, yeah? What's he saying?
S30E01_586#He says he wants Dad and Mr. Flanders
S30E01_590#to work together day after day in a tiny room,
S30E01_592#preferably holding hands.
S30E01_595#No booze, sodas, or chocolate milk.
S30E01_598#And the only snacks are celery sticks.
S30E01_600#Celery sticks.
S30E01_602#Not done yet.
S30E01_604#Dad, Jesus wants you to take Flanders bowling.
S30E01_607#Tie his shoes for him.
S30E01_609#- What for? - And kiss his ball.
S30E01_611#This is the Word of the Lord.
S30E01_613#With that kind of attention, I could roll a 73.
S30E01_629#What are you guys doing?
S30E01_631#What's it look like? We're working.
S30E01_635#Maybe we should take a break.
S30E01_636#Good idea.
S30E01_640#Okay, come on.
S30E01_642#Lenny, you've pitched "That's what she said" 30 times already.
S30E01_645#I highly doubt that's the Word of God.
S30E01_647#- Try something else. - That's what she said.
S30E01_650#That's great!
S30E01_651#That's going in.
S30E01_653#Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine.
S30E01_655#Lenny and me. Mine. Mostly mine. Mine. Mine.
S30E01_658#I was thinking it when Barney said it. Mine.
S30E01_661#Reading for Marge-- Emily Deschanel.
S30E01_664#Oh, yeah. Uh, first, I have a question for you.
S30E01_666#On Bones, did you ever have any bones
S30E01_668#with meat left on them,
S30E01_670#and if so, where are those bones?
S30E01_672#Maybe she should just read the part.
S30E01_674#Homie, because of everything that's happened,
S30E01_677#I think we need to take a break.
S30E01_679#No! Marge, no!
S30E01_681#A break means forever.
S30E01_682#I'll change. I will.
S30E01_684#No, Homer, she's just acting the part.
S30E01_688#of course, of course, yes.
S30E01_690#As a help to me, when you're acting,
S30E01_692#could you hold up one hand so I'll know?
S30E01_694#Oh, o-okay.
S30E01_696#- Thank you. - Homie.
S30E01_697#Yes, Marge. You have a question?
S30E01_699#She's acting!
S30E01_701#Right, right, right. She's acting.
S30E01_703#When you're acting, could you raise one arm
S30E01_705#and swing your foot in a circle and keep winking?
S30E01_708#Listen, Homie.
S30E01_710#Marge, what are you doing?! You're acting really weird.
S30E01_712#Is he okay?
S30E01_714#You thought I was okay when you married me.
S30E01_716#Actors.
S30E01_718#Gal Gadot reading for Lisa.
S30E01_720#- You've got the part! - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
S30E01_722#I know you were great in Fast and Furious,
S30E01_723#but what else have you been in?
S30E01_725#Did you see Wonder Woman?
S30E01_728#Whenever I see the DC logo, I immediately fall asleep.
S30E01_730#Homer, she's got the part.
S30E01_733#Okay, you get this and I get Gene Hackman for me.
S30E01_735#He already said no.
S30E01_737#Then you have to help me kidnap him.
S30E01_738#Excuse me.
S30E01_740#So, do you want to put me on tape or...?
S30E01_743#Can we use your magic lasso to kidnap Gene Hackman?
S30E01_745#No.
S30E01_747#Barney is here to read for Noah.
S30E01_749#There's no Noah in this movie.
S30E01_751#All right, but you better tell the camels.
S30E01_758#Mom, do you really believe Bart's story?
S30E01_762#Lisa, do you know how I've gotten to this point in life?
S30E01_765#Two things-- blind faith and a little wine.
S30E01_768#Can you get me the wine that I keep in Mommy's knitting basket?
S30E01_770#I know where you keep it.
S30E01_773#There was no knitting in there.
S30E01_779#Jesus said to tell you, "Things will get better."
S30E01_782#And... cut.
S30E01_784#I wish you and I had a relationship like that.
S30E01_789#They wish they had a relationship like us!
S30E01_795#Uh, there is nothing a director can do on set that's wrong.
S30E01_799#Take five, everybody.
S30E01_800#What do you want?
S30E01_802#I told you, lies lead to punishment,
S30E01_805#especially when you film them.
S30E01_807#What are you talking about?
S30E01_809#If you really saw Grandpa Bouvier,
S30E01_811#which finger was he missing?
S30E01_814#I believe he was wearing a beekeeping outfit when I saw him.
S30E01_817#Trick question. He's missing a leg.
S30E01_819#Okay.
S30E01_821#So maybe I fudged a few things.
S30E01_823#It's not the original lie that gets people.
S30E01_825#It's the cover-up.
S30E01_827#It's gonna get worse and worse
S30E01_829#and worse and worse and worse.
S30E01_832#Dad, I'm starting to feel weird.
S30E01_834#I'm not your Dad. I'm the actor playing him.
S30E01_837#You need all that padding to play Homer?
S30E01_839#Yes, and I'm fat to begin with.
S30E01_843#Okay, this one's for China.
S30E01_846#This one's for Australia.
S30E01_848#And this one's for the youth market.
S30E01_851#- Dad? - This is all because of you.
S30E01_853#I have never been so excited.
S30E01_854#Now what do you want to say?
S30E01_857#is there anything you want to tell anyone?
S30E01_859#Any inaccuracies or blatant lies?
S30E01_863#The scene we said is New York
S30E01_865#is actually downtown Calgary,
S30E01_868#and vice versa.
S30E01_875#No, no. I'm going to heaven!
S30E01_882#Hello, Bart.
S30E01_883#Didn't they give you a real leg in heaven?
S30E01_885#I lost it in a bet.
S30E01_887#A bet that my grandson was a good boy.
S30E01_889#Save me, Jesus!
S30E01_891#I'm trying very hard to forgive you.
S30E01_893#It is very tough.
S30E01_895#What are you gonna do to me?
S30E01_897#Bart, God is love.
S30E01_913#And here's Marge with the actress who played her.
S30E01_916#Oh, in real life we don't get along.
S30E01_921#Who are you worshipping?
S30E01_922#Are you telling the truth?
S30E01_924#He will not be taking any questions
S30E01_926#unless they're submitted in writing
S30E01_928#on an index card with some bacon on it.
S30E01_930#Turkey bacon does not count.
S30E01_934#Tell the people what you have witnessed, Bartholomew.
S30E01_937#And if they doubt you, viciously attack their character.
S30E01_940#Yes, Jesus.
S30E01_945#Bart, you're my hero.
S30E01_947#Now, who wants a hamburger?
S30E01_949#I would never say any of those things.
S30E01_953#Now sing, Bart.
S30E01_955#Sing because I cannot.
S30E01_960#*One more chance*
S30E01_962#*It is my destiny*
S30E01_965#*To start my road*
S30E01_968#*To Christianity*
S30E01_973#*I always knew he had a mission*
S30E01_978#*Thank God we called off the mortician*
S30E01_981#*One more chance*
S30E01_984#*He's alive, someone quick call Channe*
S30E01_988#*One more chance*
S30E01_999#Not enough Bart.
S30E01_1003#Oh, someone pinch me.
S30E01_1005#Thank you. Thank you for this Christian Oscar.
S30E01_1008#And I'd like to thank the Academy of Arts
S30E01_1010#and Anti-Sciences.
S30E01_1012#Are you guys awake?
S30E01_1014#Mm. What's the matter, sweetie?
S30E01_1016#Mom, I lied about everything.
S30E01_1019#Oh, my God!
S30E01_1021#Don't worry, Marge.
S30E01_1022#It's just a little movie. Nobody will see it.
S30E01_1024#Mr. Flanders just called.
S30E01_1026#The movie's on pace to make a hundred million dollars.
S30E01_1029#It crushed all the good movies that came out this week.
S30E01_1032#Take that, Paul Thomas Anderson.
S30E01_1035#Oh, my God. Our movie's a hit and a lie.
S30E01_1038#Oh, all hit movies are lies, Marge.
S30E01_1039#Did you see Argo?
S30E01_1041#None of that happened.
S30E01_1043#And I have strong doubts about The Incredibles.
S30E01_1045#Well, we have to tell people the truth.
S30E01_1047#Of course, of course.
S30E01_1048#Could we do it after the Golden Globes?
S30E01_1049#No!
S30E01_1051#But that's the one with TV people
S30E01_1053#and movie people in the same room.
S30E01_1055#We said no!
S30E01_1060#First off,
S30E01_1062#we will donate every penny of our profits to charity.
S30E01_1065#Keeping only enough money
S30E01_1067#to cover changing our lives in a major way.
S30E01_1069#Hey, what is this?
S30E01_1072#Fine, fine, fine, all of it.
S30E01_1074#Okay, look, I just want to say,
S30E01_1076#I'm just a man trying to raise his son.
S30E01_1078#I make mistakes.
S30E01_1080#Sometimes they're little, sometimes they're big.
S30E01_1082#Blame me,
S30E01_1084#but don't blame the boy for being a boy.
S30E01_1089#And let me just ask this. Is it possible
S30E01_1092#any other religious beliefs are founded on myths?
S30E01_1094#This interview is over.
S30E01_1096#God created the world in seven days. See you later.
S30E01_1098#In what some are calling the worst scandal
S30E01_1100#in the history of religion,
S30E01_1101#Bart Simpson lied
S30E01_1103#when he claimed he had talked to Jesus.
S30E01_1106#But maybe part of the fault lies with us
S30E01_1109#for desperately wanting a miracle in these troubled times.
S30E01_1112#Times which we bring into your homes
S30E01_1113#at 5:00, 6:00 and 11:00.
S30E01_1115#Here's a hobo lost in a hurricane.
S30E01_1118#Um, I had a hat!
S30E01_1120#Hey, Bart.
S30E01_1121#I brought you some ice cream.
S30E01_1122#Up here.
S30E01_1127#The only friend I have is the Frisbee on the roof.
S30E01_1131#Well, you'll always have me.
S30E01_1133#Careful.
S30E01_1135#Dad didn't nail these in too well.
S30E01_1137#You think God'll forgive me?
S30E01_1138#Don't tell anyone I said that.
S30E01_1140#Well, if there is a God, from what I know,
S30E01_1143#said God will forgive you
S30E01_1145#if you truly have remorse in your heart.
S30E01_1147#Well, thanks, Lis.
S30E01_1148#Don't tell anyone I asked you that.
S30E01_1150#I did it 'cause you're the smartest person I know.
S30E01_1152#And don't tell anybody I said that.
S30E01_1154#I won't!
S30E01_1160#Dad must have raked the leaves today.
S30E01_1162#Now that's a miracle.
S30E01_1172#I made it.
S30E01_1177#Gal Gadot?!
S30E01_1179#They like me so much, I get to visit.
S30E01_1182#I made it, too, boy, and Jesus really wants to meet you.
S30E01_1184#Go on in!
S30E01_1186#Where are you going?
S30E01_1188#This place is so boring.
S30E01_1191#Time for another game of "Mother, May I?"
S30E01_1196#Please send me back to Earth.
S30E01_1198#Yes, yes. You can be a turtle or a pharmaceutical CEO.

S30E02_44#Kayla, don't step on the stem. You'll flip the pad.
S30E02_47#You should know that. You're life coach.
S30E02_52#- They flipped the pad! - They flipped the pad.
S30E02_54#What a noob.
S30E02_60#Hector and Audrey Chang, you have won
S30E02_63#The Amazing Place!
S30E02_64#Called it.
S30E02_66#Mom, you always call the winner.
S30E02_67#How do you know?
S30E02_69#Well, your father may have Moe's and football,
S30E02_71#but I have being by myself and this show.
S30E02_74#Do you like adventure, bandanas
S30E02_76#and having your friends see you melt down on TV?
S30E02_80#We want you for season 48 of The Amazing Place.
S30E02_84#Why don't you guys try out for that show?
S30E02_86#You would dominate.
S30E02_87#Oh, no, I couldn't.
S30E02_89#You know what they say: you don't fail
S30E02_92#at 100% of the shots you don't take.
S30E02_94#But you've watched every episode of the show
S30E02_97#and listened to the director commentaries.
S30E02_99#You even made us play the terrible home game.
S30E02_104#- Come on, Mom. - Just try out.
S30E02_106#- Come on, try out. - Come on.
S30E02_107#- Come on, try out. - Try out.
S30E02_109#- Try out. - Try out, Mom.
S30E02_112#- Try out! - Try out!
S30E02_113#- Come on, just do it, Mom! - Come on!
S30E02_115#Just try out!
S30E02_117#- Come on. - Mom.
S30E02_119#- Just try out. - Why don't you try out?
S30E02_121#- Just try out. - Come on, do it.
S30E02_123#I'm not trying out, so just can it.
S30E02_129#I said "Can it" to my own children.
S30E02_130#What have I become?
S30E02_132#Baby, you've got to tell them sometime.
S30E02_134#Tell us what?
S30E02_135#We know all the family secrets.
S30E02_137#Like that Dad lost our college funds
S30E02_139#investing in a chain of chewing tobacco cafes.
S30E02_142#Dippin' Dens was a great idea.
S30E02_144#We just weren't prepared for all the spitting.
S30E02_146#Well, I might as well come clean.
S30E02_152#The real tragedy is now Chaw House owns
S30E02_154#the entire casual chewing market.
S30E02_160#The truth is, we have tried out.
S30E02_162#Dozens of times.
S30E02_166#Why should you pick us to be on The Amazing Place?
S30E02_169#Because we're best friends who never bicker.
S30E02_173#Wee constantly at each other's throats.
S30E02_177#We're motorcycle bikers.
S30E02_179#That's our persona.
S30E02_182#We have no idea what you want.
S30E02_184#Just please pick us.
S30E02_186#Why are you still doing this?
S30E02_188#We were already on that show
S30E02_190#where we had to crawl into a drainage ditch.
S30E02_192#That was just you, and it wasn't a show.
S30E02_194#It was a police bodycam.
S30E02_196#That was a good show.
S30E02_199#After 46 rejections, I can take a hint.
S30E02_202#They don't want us.
S30E02_208#You know, reality shows love a sob story,
S30E02_211#and we've got a storage bin full of tears.
S30E02_214#And I've got a sister who will edit them together
S30E02_216#while I feed the dog marshmallows
S30E02_217#and see what happens.
S30E02_235#Oh, we're not here to make friends.
S30E02_237#Unless I meet some awesome guy who-who wants to be my friend.
S30E02_240#Yeah, I met this really cool guy at the boba place,
S30E02_243#but he said he was moving to Hong Kong and, uh,
S30E02_245#he didn't know his number yet.
S30E02_248#Every reality show needs that crazy, no-limits guy
S30E02_251#that just shatters society's taboos, right?
S30E02_253#Well, break out your pixelation machine,
S30E02_257#because I am your bug-eating nude fatso.
S30E02_261#Oh, also, I'm not here to make friends.
S30E02_266#Oh, my God, married kids?
S30E02_267#You're in the show.
S30E02_268#Ew, no.
S30E02_270#We're here on behalf of some different weirdos.
S30E02_273#Our parents have tried out for every season
S30E02_274#of The Amazing Place.
S30E02_276#My dad would even record my mom
S30E02_278#opening your letters in case they got picked.
S30E02_292#So think what a magical TV moment it would be
S30E02_295#for our mom to find out she made it on the show.
S30E02_297#After losing all hope.
S30E02_299#When she didn't even know she applied.
S30E02_302#The ultimate superfan gets one last chance
S30E02_305#to make her dreams come true.
S30E02_307#I don't know, it sounds a little manipulative.
S30E02_309#You're fired.
S30E02_311#I think we just found our Boston Rob.
S30E02_314#Or your Springfield Clancy.
S30E02_316#Huh? Huh?
S30E02_320#Ectric bill, past due,
S30E02_323#Website renewal "DippinDens.Com."

S30E02_336#Tag Buggernut?
S30E02_338#This is it. After years of rejection,
S30E02_340#you two will finally compete for a million dollars
S30E02_342#on The Amazing Place.
S30E02_344#But we didn't even try out.
S30E02_346#I edited together your old auditions.
S30E02_349#And I gave notes which were ignored.
S30E02_352#My crazy dream is coming true.
S30E02_355#After you sign the amazing waivers.
S30E02_359#So many ways to die.
S30E02_362#Falling off rocks, rocks falling on me.
S30E02_365#Toxoplasmosis?
S30E02_367#That's what ate Handsome Tom's face.
S30E02_369#Just call me Handsome Homer.
S30E02_372#- Bye, Mom! - Don't get toxoplasmosis!
S30E02_379#Welcome to The Amazing Place.
S30E02_381#You're about to embark on a test of mental toughness,
S30E02_384#physical strength and interviews where you have to pretend
S30E02_385#that you're in the middle of a challenge
S30E02_387#when it's already over.
S30E02_390#But first, let's kick things off with a romantic beachside luau
S30E02_393#at Lover's Lagoon.
S30E02_397#Right after your first challenge.
S30E02_399#We took one item from every person's bag
S30E02_401#and hid it in another contestant's luggage.
S30E02_404#Everyone, find their Suitcase Stowaway now.
S30E02_408#It's the ultimate Tarmac Unpack Attack.
S30E02_410#Okay, Suitcase Stowaway.
S30E02_412#They've done this three times before.
S30E02_414#Here's the secret: dump and dig.
S30E02_417#I found my stowaway.
S30E02_421#Great. Go through my other bag.
S30E02_429#Okay, Homie, don't panic.
S30E02_431#The secret is to just take your time, and...yo
S30E02_437#I'm sorry, Homer and Marge, you've been...
S30E02_439#- Don't say it. - ...shell-iminated.
S30E02_441#No, no. No, no, no.
S30E02_443#We can't be the first couple kicked off.
S30E02_445#That's the ultimate humiliation.
S30E02_453#I never even put on a swimsuit.
S30E02_455#I never got to see the lagoon.
S30E02_458#I'm crying, and no one's even filming me.
S30E02_464#We can't even make it off the tarmac.
S30E02_467#All because of my screwup.
S30E02_469#I guess we're going home.
S30E02_470#No, you're going there.
S30E02_475#A hotel? But we lost.
S30E02_477#If we let you go home now, fans would know
S30E02_479#you've been kicked off before the season airs.
S30E02_481#So ejected contestants must stay at this hotel
S30E02_484#until every epise is finished taping.
S30E02_487#So we can't go home for a month?
S30E02_489#Six weeks, counting post.
S30E02_491#I don't know what post is.
S30E02_494#Hey, save some of those tears for the reunion show.
S30E02_497#You'll just put us in the back row and won't ask any questions.
S30E02_500#We won't even get to hug the winner.
S30E02_502#Yeah, but the runner-up's always wandering around
S30E02_504#looking for someone to hug.
S30E02_505#That's your play.
S30E02_509#How could I be such a noob?
S30E02_511#I could learn to love a noob, given time.
S30E02_514#I already miss the kids.
S30E02_516#Well, there's got to be a way we can call home
S30E02_518#without getting in trouble.
S30E02_521#If you say anything that reveals or implies
S30E02_523#that you have been ejected from The Amazing Place,
S30E02_525#you are subject to a fine of up to a million dollars
S30E02_527#and, for residents of Georgia, the death penalty.
S30E02_532#Kids, kids, how are you?
S30E02_534#Lisa said I can't use the bubble bath,
S30E02_536#but you said you bought it for everybody.
S30E02_537#Forget the bubble bath.
S30E02_538#How's the show?
S30E02_539#Are you winning?
S30E02_541#Um, I'm not supposed to say.
S30E02_543#That means you're dominating.
S30E02_544#I knew it!
S30E02_545#No, no, we're not dominating.
S30E02_548#I didn't reveal or imply that.
S30E02_550#Well, you can't have gotten kicked off yet.
S30E02_552#You just got there.
S30E02_558#"Your mother and I are excited
S30E02_560#to be part of the Amazing Place family.
S30E02_562#All further inquiries should be submitted in writing

S30E02_569#This conversation is hereby terminated.
S30E02_571#You are each entitled to one capful of bubble bath.
S30E02_576#Now, that's parenting.
S30E02_579#Come on, baby, it's not so bad.
S30E02_581#Really?
S30E02_583#Six weeks away from the kids,
S30E02_586#Grampa, my sisters, your job.
S30E02_589#With nothing to do but eat free room service
S30E02_593#and watch dopey movies on demand while they keep us quiet
S30E02_596#with an endless supply of free booze.
S30E02_598#It's a nightmare.
S30E02_600#It is. It truly is.

S30E02_611#Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
S30E02_612#You see, Curtis,
S30E02_614#you never really get an episode of SportsCenter
S30E02_617#until you've seen it for the third time.
S30E02_619#Can I freshen up that appetizer platter for you?P
S30E02_622#Nah, I better go check in on my wife.
S30E02_624#She's having a hard time adjusting to hotel living.
S30E02_632#Just let me clean.
S30E02_639#Sweetie, I'm worried about you.
S30E02_640#You just sit around all day changing
S30E02_642#the combination on the room safe.
S30E02_645#Do you want to put something in the room safe?
S30E02_646#I don't deserve valuables.
S30E02_648#It's my fault we're stuck here.
S30E02_650#All I deserve is to sit alone
S30E02_652#and watch the TV channel that's about the hotel.
S30E02_655#Forgot your toothbrush? No problem.
S30E02_658#Sundries gift shop has all the toiletries every traveler needs.
S30E02_661#Sundries is awesome. I got this shirt there.
S30E02_665#Look, I know you're miserable,
S30E02_667#but let me show you how great this place can be.
S30E02_670#It's just a stupid chain hotel.
S30E02_674#Darling, take my hand, and you'll see it's so much more.
S30E02_677#* Well, since you blew the challenge *
S30E02_679#* And we're not allowed to tell *
S30E02_682#We're getting all expenses paid at

S30E02_736#Might the lady enjoy a movie
S30E02_739#whose title doesn't appear on the bill?
S30E02_751#Maybe being trapped here isn't so bad.
S30E02_753#I'm not even worried about what the kids are up to.
S30E02_756#Come on, dig. Dig.
S30E02_758#We're hot.
S30E02_760#You can go for a nice, cool swim
S30E02_763#after you finish digging my pool.
S30E02_765#I'm telling Patty and Selma what you're doing.
S30E02_767#What? We want a pool.
S30E02_769#I just got my first wax in years.
S30E02_771#Hurt so much they had to give me an epidural.
S30E02_777#Haw-haw!
S30E02_781#The fitness center only had an old NordicTrack,
S30E02_784#but it felt good to work out.
S30E02_786#I sat on a yoga ball and drank cucumber water.
S30E02_788#It's nice to know I can still do that.
S30E02_791#Mm, maybe we should peek in.
S30E02_793#I am kind of curious to see what's going on in the show.
S30E02_796#Really? You sure you can handle it?
S30E02_797#Oh, yeah.
S30E02_800#I'm still in a great mood after reading that free USA Today.

S30E02_814#Great. Go through my other bag.
S30E02_817#Hey, that's me looking for that thing.
S30E02_820#Okay. Marge's vitamins, Marge's pajamas,
S30E02_823#Marge's giant chocolate bar.
S30E02_825#I didn't pack a giant chocolate bar.
S30E02_829#What Marge doesn't know
S30E02_831#is that her husband just ate her Suitcase Stowaway.
S30E02_835#This ultimate "Didgeri-don't" will send them packing.
S30E02_839#I'm not the one who screwed up. You are.
S30E02_841#I'm so sorry.
S30E02_843#I know you're gonna need some space,
S30E02_844#so I'll sleep on the couch.
S30E02_887#What a dump.
S30E02_889#What's that from?
S30E02_891#-What? -"What a dump."
S30E02_893#How would I know?
S30E02_895#We wouldn't be in this dump if you weren't such a flop.
S30E02_898#I'm tired, dear. It's late.
S30E02_900#A chocolate flop.
S30E02_903#Yes, a chocolate flop.
S30E02_905#That's what you keep braying at everybody.
S30E02_907#I don't bray!
S30E02_909#All right, you don't bray.
S30E02_911#I do not bray!
S30E02_913#I said you didn't bray.
S30E02_914#Make me a drink.
S30E02_915#Haven't you had enough?
S30E02_916#Make me a drink
S30E02_917#Yes, dear.
S30E02_921#And lay out some mixed nuts. We've got guests.
S30E02_924#-We've got what? -Guests. Guests!
S30E02_927#You know, what's-their-names.
S30E02_928#I don't know their names.
S30E02_930#They just got eliminated from the show.
S30E02_933#It took them five weeks, not five minutes.
S30E02_937#Go answer the door.
S30E02_939#All right, love, whatever love wants.
S30E02_941#Get the door. The door!
S30E02_943#I'm getting the door.
S30E02_945#You don't have to bray like some subhuman monster.
S30E02_948#Oh, go to hell!
S30E02_953#Hi! Hi, there. Come on in.
S30E02_955#This is, um...
S30E02_956#Honey.
S30E02_958#And this is Nick.

S30E02_967#That's me.
S30E02_969#Hey, sourpuss, why don't you mix them a drink?
S30E02_971#Yes, dear.
S30E02_976#I love your room.
S30E02_978#We have the exact same paintings.
S30E02_984#You were this close to winning The Three-Legged Chase.
S30E02_988#You were right in ther Nick, right at the meat of things.
S30E02_992#There's no limit to you, is there?
S30E02_994#And how would you have played the Three-Legged Chase?
S30E02_997#Why don't I show you?
S30E02_1000#- Don't encourage her. - Encourage me.

S30E02_1022#You can tear me apart like the box the shower cap came in.
S30E02_1025#That's perfectly okay, that's all right.
S30E02_1027#You can stand it.
S30E02_1028#I cannot stand it!
S30E02_1030#You can stand it
S30E02_1032#You married me for it.
S30E02_1035#- Our son is dead. - No, he isn't.
S30E02_1038#-We have no son! -Yes, we do!
S30E02_1041#Oh, yeah, Bart.
S30E02_1045#Man, last night sure was a searing portrait
S30E02_1047#of a marriage in turmoil.
S30E02_1050#It's still in turmoil, you chocolate-gobbling dream killer.
S30E02_1055#Attention, everyone, gather by the bowl of mini yogurts.
S30E02_1058#For the first time ever on The Amazing Place,
S30E02_1060#two eliminated contestants will be brought back
S30E02_1062#to compete in the finale.
S30E02_1066#But here's the catch, to get back in,
S30E02_1068#you have to dump your loved one for another partner.
S30E02_1070#So, if your spouse screwed up,
S30E02_1072#this is your chance to cut them loose.
S30E02_1075#It's the Dead Weight Drop.
S30E02_1079#I choose Nick.
S30E02_1081#That's got to sting, Homer.
S30E02_1083#I'm just glad my friends and family
S30E02_1085#are never going to see me humiliated like this.
S30E02_1093#This is it, the final challenge:
S30E02_1095#Mango Tango.
S30E02_1097#First, pick and peel enough fresh mango
S30E02_1099#to make six mango-ritas,
S30E02_1102#which you must then carry across a log bridge.
S30E02_1106#But under the bridge is a pack of mango-loving monkeys,
S30E02_1108#which can only be soothed
S30E02_1110#with music played on a pennywhistle.
S30E02_1113#Also, there will be a Kia Sportage in the background
S30E02_1115#that we couldn't figure out how to fit into the challenge.
S30E02_1118#Your Mango Tango starts now.
S30E02_1122#And Marge draws first fruit.
S30E02_1124#I'll make the mango-ritas.
S30E02_1126#Great teamwork.
S30E02_1128#Could this be a million-dollar puree?
S30E02_1131#I'll handle those monkeys.
S30E02_1139#It's the ultimate groovy chill-out flute jam.
S30E02_1142#Look, the monkeys are mellowing.
S30E02_1145#This is our Kia Sporge Moment.
S30E02_1150#I did it.
S30E02_1152#We won. Without Homer.
S30E02_1156#Marge and Nick,
S30E02_1158#I want to congratulate you on winning The Amazing Place.
S30E02_1161#Yay! -I want to, but I can't.
S30E02_1166#Because you failed to salt the rims of your mango-ritas,
S30E02_1169#rendering them mango-nothings.
S30E02_1173#I screwed up a recipe?
S30E02_1176#So get out of the way of the actual winners, Shawn and Barry.
S30E02_1180#Our rims are super salty.
S30E02_1187#Hey! Hey, hey, come on. Oh!
S30E02_1190#I am such a noob.
S30E02_1194#I am such a noob.
S30E02_1197#What a noob.
S30E02_1199#- Total noob. - Classic noob.
S30E02_1202#Homie, Ias such a jerk. How can I make it up to you?
S30E02_1206#Sweetheart, you already have.
S30E02_1208#I am such a noob.
S30E02_1212#I've screwed up so many times in our marriage,
S30E02_1215#and people always feel so sorry for you.
S30E02_1219#But with this epic noob blunder, I'm the one they pity.
S30E02_1223#Oh... pity. Oh...
S30E02_1226#Is this how you feel all the time?
S30E02_1229#Uh, kind of. I just never let myself enjoy it.
S30E02_1232#Oh, pity feels good.
S28E11_139#Done and done.
S28E11_141#Wait, wait. Why is it so easy?
S28E11_143#- Moving on. - ?Oh, man!
S28E11_145#I thought your mother was gonna tell us that Grampa died.
S28E11_147#Well, the meeting ain't over yet.
S28E11_149#The monks' philosophy is simple.
S28E11_151#Take every item you own and ask:
S28E11_154#does it still bring me joy?
S28E11_155#If yes, then you keep it.
S28E11_157#If not, you thank it for its service
S28E11_159#- and throw it away. - Boring!
S28E11_161#Does this beverage coaster give me joy?
S28E11_163#Not anymore.
S28E11_165#Not my "Oh, crap, I'm 50" coaster!
S28E11_169#You're not 50, and I don't like the word "Crap."
S28E11_172#And I worry you drink too much beer.
S28E11_173#But the rest of it's good, right?
S28E11_175#That's all there is to it.
S28E11_177#Marge, before you go cuckoo with cleanliness
S28E11_179#and throw everything out, think of the kids.
S28E11_182#The kids working in overseas factories
S28E11_184#to make this crap.
S28E11_186#It's time for it to go.
S28E11_188#Coaster, thank you for your service.
S28E11_191#No one ever thanked me when I was in the service.
S28E11_193#All I got was a pack of cigarettes
S28E11_195#and a college education!
S28E11_197#Speaking ?of college education...
S28E11_199#- Meeting adjourned! - Oh, man.
S28E11_200#Let's see.
S28E11_201#Car door handles,
S28E11_203#a telescope and a hose.
S28E11_205#Did this junk bring me joy?
S28E11_215#Why did I wear mother's blouse today?
S28E11_223#Thank you, Galileo.
S28E11_227#Good-bye, Businesswoman Malibu Stacy,
S28E11_229#Plus-Size Malibu Stacy,
S28E11_231#and Nongender-Normative Malibu Stacy.
S28E11_233#Your attempts to enter the 21st century brought joy to no one.
S28E11_236#Are they worth anything?
S28E11_238#Oh, I'm afraid not, no.
S28E11_240#Take 'em.
S28E11_245#All right, because up until now I've been such a great guy.
S28E11_249#You don't want to get rid of this fake barf?
S28E11_250#Still gives me joy.
S28E11_252#This pencil sharpener shaped like a nose?
S28E11_255#That's what it is? Now I like it even more!
S28E11_258#Is there anything you want to get rid of?
S28E11_260#Let's see.
S28E11_262#Joy, joy, joy,
S28E11_263#joy, joy, joy, joy...
S28E11_264#Milhouse, get out of the way.
S28E11_266#Joy, joy, joy, joy, joy,
S28E11_268#and Lisa's only "B." Super joy.
S28E11_270#Huh! It's in phys ed!
S28E11_272#I don't want to alarm you, but grade point average:
S28E11_275#3.999999999...
S28E11_288#Listen, Marge, you've had me throw a lot of things away
S28E11_290#that I really loved.
S28E11_293#At long last, I'm Mr. Plow!
S28E11_297#I was thinking we might want to save my 2014 Joke-A-Day calendar,
S28E11_300#'cause the calendar's the same in the year 2031,
S28E11_303#and we're really gonna need some laughs then
S28E11_304#after World War China.
S28E11_306#There is one thing of yours
S28E11_308#that's not giving us much joy anymore.
S28E11_311#You know what's not giving me joy is that Japanese book.
S28E11_313#- What'd you say? - ?Nothing.
S28E11_316#What I'm talking about is... Plopper.
S28E11_318#Spider-Pig?
S28E11_322#*Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig*
S28E11_325#*Does whatever*
S28E11_327#*A Spider-Pig does...*
S28E11_329#We've had him since you found him,
S28E11_331#but I'm the only one who takes care of him.
S28E11_334#How hard can it be to clean up after a pig?
S28E11_340#Okay, okay, I hear you, Marge.
S28E11_343#Look, I'm the only one who feeds him,
S28E11_345#cleans him, and maintains his wallow.
S28E11_347#I am grateful beyond words.
S28E11_350#I bet you didn't even know it was called a wallow.
S28E11_352#- I certainly did! - Then tell me what it's called.
S28E11_354#What what was called?
S28E11_355#The word I just said.
S28E11_357#Marge, I don't know what the word is.
S28E11_359#Let's not wallow in this all day.
S28E11_362#Please, just promise you'll find him a new place to live.
S28E11_369#That's a Christmas card!
S28E11_373#The music of our lives.
S28E11_375#If you don't find a home for that pig,
S28E11_377#- I'm going to withhold - No, whatever you're going to withhold
S28E11_379#anything but that!
S28E11_381#I'll find him a home!
S28E11_385#Boy, I really don't want to get rid of the pig.
S28E11_387#Can you talk to your mother?
S28E11_389#- We have a pig? - Oh, it's hopeless.
S28E11_391#You know, I love this animal,
S28E11_393#so I'm gonna be very selective with his new owner.
S28E11_398#Okay. World's best pig,
S28E11_400#Non-smoker only.
S28E11_402#By which I mean he can't end up in your smoker.
S28E11_407#Wow, I've already got a taker.
S28E11_410#Well, I'm sure he's a nice, reputable guy.
S28E11_416#Hello there.
S28E11_419#Are you here for my pig?
S28E11_422#I might be. I have to make sure the bacon is worth the takin'. 
S28E11_424#You better not eat him!
S28E11_426#I have to talk to him every night on the phone.
S28E11_428#- We have a code word. - Um, is it "Oink"?
S28E11_431#Damn it! I'm not giving him to you!
S28E11_434#You make guys with a windowless van look bad!
S28E11_436#Need a ride?
S28E11_438#Sure.
S28E11_441#Hey, how you doing?
S28E11_445#So, what do you do?
S28E11_448#Oh my God!
S28E11_452#A decluttered life is a happy life.
S28E11_454#A decluttered life is a happy life.
S28E11_456#A decluttered life is a h...
S28E11_458#Joyce Carol Oates!
S28E11_460#Oh, no!
S28E11_462#I threw out my autogph book!
S28E11_464#Are you nuts? You had Dean Cain!
S28E11_466#I know I had Dean Cain!
S28E11_469#Dad, maybe she'll sign a menu.
S28E11_473#Books and checks-- that's all I sign.
S28E11_478#What are you doin'?
S28E11_480#You keep-a that unsliced prosciutto outside my restaurant!
S28E11_483#Wait. How come he can bring a dog in,
S28E11_486#but my pig has to stay outside, like a common snowman?
S28E11_489#Because that-a dog is a therapy animal.
S28E11_492#He's-a licensed to help calm those with anxiety.
S28E11_496#Don't lick my face-- the makeup's lead-based.
S28E11_500#But for calming down, I prefer my mama's methods.
S28E11_502#Shut up!
S28E11_504#She don't even-a work here.
S28E11_507#So if I get that anxiety diagnosis,
S28E11_510#Plopper could follow me anywhere.
S28E11_511#He could live in my office!
S28E11_513#Hey, what are the symptoms of anxiety?
S28E11_516#Oh, no, don't try that, Dad. You might get into trouble.
S28E11_519#Just the thought of it is making me sweat.
S28E11_521#And my heart is palpitating.
S28E11_523#Lisa, honey, Daddy will help you,
S28E11_525#right after you tell me the symptoms of anxiety.
S28E11_528#You're... looking at them!
S28E11_531#Honey, I'm so sorry.
S28E11_533#- It's okay. - It's... I know.
S28E11_535#- I'm better now. - It's gonna be okay.
S28E11_537#- It's okay. I'm better now. - All right, calm down.
S28E11_539#Heart's racing like a rabbit.
S28E11_540#I have to sit down.
S28E11_542#Oh, isn't that-a sweet?
S28E11_545#All the little children have-a the adult anxiety now.
S28E11_548#Uh, yeah, I'm really anxious, Doc.
S28E11_550#I'm not sleeping at night, I'm not sleeping at work...
S28E11_553#Okay, okay, I get it.
S28E11_556#Here's your prescription for medicinal marijuana.
S28E11_558#I don't want weed!
S28E11_561#I'd like a letter for a therapy animal of the pig persuasion.
S28E11_564#Oh, you fakers disgust me!
S28E11_567#Get out! You're harshing my clinic.
S28E11_569#How many opioids would you like?
S28E11_571#I don't want any!
S28E11_573#Oh, come on, you've got to be dependent on something.
S28E11_576#I just want a prescription for a therapy pig.
S28E11_579#Fine. Plus five opioids.
S28E11_582#Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco.
S28E11_585#And one for the doctor.
S28E11_591#Gee, I didn't realize you had gone this far.
S28E11_594#A great musician only needs her instrument.
S28E11_597#And underwear-- 'cause this dress is mighty short.
S28E11_599#Time for a riff of joy.
S28E11_607#Holding this, I feel only hours of tedious practice.
S28E11_610#Where is the joy?
S28E11_620#That was beautiful, honey!
S28E11_622#No, it wasn't.
S28E11_624#I finally feel about my sax...
S28E11_626#the way you all do.
S28E11_635#Okay, Plopper, I'm going to the little pigs' room.
S28E11_637#Can you cover for me?
S28E11_640#Good, good. Not that many mistakes at all.
S28E11_649#Okay, is that Homer or a pig that looks just like him?
S28E11_654#Sounds like Homer, but smells like truffles.
S28E11_656#Toss in a bag of chips.
S28E11_662#Yep, that's Homer.
S28E11_664#- Who's Homer? ?- The pig behind the desk.
S28E11_666#To a less secure man, being mistaken for a pig
S28E11_668#would be a wakeup call.
S28E11_669#This is great.
S28E11_672#All I had to do was say I'm crazy on my permanent record,
S28E11_675#and I get to bring a pig to work.
S28E11_677#- Yeah, they are pretty lax here. - ?That's right.
S28E11_678#I got turned down by McDonald's, 
S28E11_680#but, here, they paid me the whole year I was in jail.
S28E11_683#You said you were getting rid of him.
S28E11_685#Marge, I'll take him to work and to Moe's.
S28E11_687#He'll be like me-- you'll barely see him.
S28E11_690#Fine.
S28E11_696#This is so hard for me to say,
S28E11_699#but my saxophone no longer gives me joy.
S28E11_702#I am giving it away.
S28E11_704#Aw, that is really, really sad.
S28E11_707#Wow, you understand how I feel.
S28E11_710#Yes, because I feel about my pig
S28E11_712#the way you used to feel about your honk-a-ma-flute.
S28E11_715#Okay, back to what really matters.
S28E11_717#So, I get the ball and I pivot to first...
S28E11_720#Oh, my God!
S28E11_721#- I'm so sorry, dad! - Accidents happen.
S28E11_726#Wow, Homie. Spilled gravy
S28E11_728#is one of your top three strangulation triggers.
S28E11_732#I could never strangle a boy in front of the pig.
S28E11_736#I think he really has become a support animal for you.
S28E11_739#He's totally changed the way I look at animals.
S28E11_742#Pass the pork chops.
S28E11_750#Everybody's looking at us.
S28E11_753#It's like bringing Elizabeth Taylor to the Oscars.
S28E11_759#Can I pet your pig?
S28E11_761#Of course! You can all pet him!
S28E11_764#Kiss both ends. 
S28E11_767#Homie, those kids' hands are covered in barbeque sauce.
S28E11_770#I know someone who's gonna get a sink bath tonight.
S28E11_789#No! Get away from him!
S28E11_791#- I'll spray you! ?- Dad, no!
S28E11_793#That's a snake from the petting zoo!
S28E11_807#Oh, my God!
S28E11_808#Oh, my God!
S28E11_811#I can't breathe. Chest pounding.
S28E11_813#- What's happening to me?! - You're having an anxiety attack.
S28E11_815#There really is such a thing?!
S28E11_819#The dogs contused his baby back ribs.
S28E11_822#Of course, there is the luau option.
S28E11_825#I will not subject him to something
S28E11_827#that has three vowels in a row.
S28E11_829#Uh, sir, I'm kind of worried about a lawsuit.
S28E11_832#Our Lloyd's of London policy excludes the hounds.
S28E11_834#Ooh! Damn that Lloyd. 
S28E11_836#He's borne a grudge 
S28E11_838#ever since I took his girl to see Lunardi's balloon.
S28E11_839#What are you talking about?
S28E11_841#I'm not sure myself.
S28E11_843#But don't worry, I'll have your swine taken care of right here 
S28E11_845#in the finest sanatorium money can buy.
S28E11_847#What the...
S28E11_850#Maybe he should go to an animal hospital.
S28E11_853#Oh, we'll take good care of Spider-Pig.
S28E11_855#You know his secret identity?
S28E11_857#Mm-hmm. And your son is El Barto.
S28E11_859#These things are very easy to figure out.
S28E11_860#We'll take good care of him!
S28E11_863#I'm worried, Marge.
S28E11_865#His tail is all curly.
S28E11_866#It's always been curly.
S28E11_868#No, you're thinking of Bart when he was a baby.
S28E11_871#But this is no time to argue.
S28E11_872#He'll be fine. 
S28E11_874#This place seems even nicer than the Mayo Clinic.
S28E11_877#Mayo Clinic, eh?
S28E11_880#Should we slice him diagonally or just cut off the crust?
S28E11_883#- Who cares? It's hopeless. - You fools.
S28E11_886#I'll save him like I've saved a million lunches!
S28E11_896#It gets harder every time.
S28E11_902#You were imagining a clinic full of mayonnaise doctors, weren't you? 
S28E11_905#Some were just interns.
S28E11_908#What happened to your stuff?
S28E11_910#Gave it all away. Nothing brings me joy.
S28E11_912#Lis, for what it's worth, 
S28E11_914#there was a time I thought my life was horrible, too. ?
S28E11_916#Really?
S28E11_917#Basically, it was when you were born.
S28E11_920#Thanks. I'm all cheered up.
S28E11_922#But I got over it.
S28E11_924#And your older, smarter brother is going to help you.
S28E11_926#Let's put our heads together.
S28E11_930#This actually is making me smarter.
S28E11_933#And next week, we will have the MRT,
S28E11_936#Mandatory Required Test.
S28E11_939#Students must bring two pencils and a quiet lunch.
S28E11_943#This is WJZZ, Springfield Elementary's pirate jazz station.
S28E11_947#Good Lord, how is he overpowering my P.A. System?
S28E11_950#We are preempting these lame-o school announcements
S28E11_952#with an original composition from Lisa Simpson.
S28E11_955#Warning, this may cancel math.
S28E11_969#It sounds like how paste tastes.
S28E11_974#You did it, Bart!
S28E11_976#You brought back my joy.
S28E11_980#I wouldn't have done it if I knew there was a hug at the end.
S28E11_984#Hold that thought.
S28E11_986#School is canceled for the rest of the day.
S28E11_988#I do have a lot of errands to run.
S28E11_993#There. Good as new.
S28E11_995#I also took the liberty of putting
S28E11_997#a pop-up thermometer in him, just in case.
S28E11_1001#Excellent. Now, doctor, the matter of your bill...
S28E11_1004#It's on me. I always enjoy the chance
S28E11_1006#to get my hands inside a pig.
S28E11_1007#Good day.
S28E11_1014#Oh, my God.
S28E11_1016#This reminds me of a golden moment
S28E11_1018#with my beloved, ruthless papa.
S28E11_1028#Yale wins! And only three killed!
S28E11_1031#From this day hence, 
S28E11_1034#this beautiful creature will be my faithful companion.
S28E11_1037#I-I thought I was your faithful companion.
S28E11_1039#A man can have two faithful companions.
S28E11_1042#But one is always his favorite.
S28E11_1056#You've stolen my therapy animal.
S28E11_1058#Now I have to control my own emotions.
S28E11_1061#Well, he's still too ill to travel.
S28E11_1076#Now what's wrong?
S28E11_1078#My joy's returned, but my sax is gone.
S28E11_1082#I just want my passion back.
S28E11_1084#- Come with me. - Is it related?
S28E11_1086#Yes.
S28E11_1089#The Japanese may have tidiness,
S28E11_1092#but, in America, we have storage lockers,
S28E11_1095#our only growth industry.
S28E11_1096#Look.
S28E11_1099#Oh, my God! You kept all our stuff!
S28E11_1102#Well, I couldn't throw anything out.
S28E11_1104#I wanted to be tidy, but I could only shift.
S28E11_1108#Hello, old friend!
S28E11_1115#Could you keep it down?
S28E11_1117#Some of us are trying to throw a wedding in here!
S28E11_1119#Go ahead, Reverend. Start at "Dearly beloved."
S28E11_1138#Plopper, meet me at the side door,
S28E11_1142#the one on the east wing by the greenhouse.
S28E11_1145#Take the elevator to Floor 2-R.
S28E11_1148#Not 2. 2-R.
S28E11_1150#That'll put you in the map room.
S28E11_1152#Take the second set of stairs.
S28E11_1155#Repeat, second set of stairs...
S28E11_1159#Well, finally.
S28E11_1164#Heel!
S28E11_1167#I, uh, know what it's like to have true love thwarted.
S28E11_1171#Just take your pig and go
S28E11_1173#before the old man realizes what's what.
S28E11_1175#- What's what? - Go!
S28E11_1211#Marge, he brings me joy.
S28E11_1213#And to keep him, I'll give up beer.
S28E11_1215#Deal. 
S28E11_1236#Fruit?! What a nightmare!
S28E14_78#- Look what I got! - My painting!
S28E14_80#The pi¨¨ce de r¨¦sistance of my memorabilia collection!
S28E14_82#Not since I was the winning bidder
S28E14_84#on a Ziploc full of Jonathan Frakes' beard trimmings 
S28E14_86#have I been so... Aw, dang it.
S28E14_89#Gross! Raisin blood!
S28E14_96#I did it.
S28E14_106#Bart and I haven't always been the best of friends. ?
S28E14_109#And we're here to tell you a story of a time
S28E14_112#when we really didn't get along.
S28E14_114#But we found our way!
S28E14_116#And we like each other better than ever!
S28E14_119#Way to spoil the ending, nerd-burger.
S28E14_121#Nerd-burger.
S28E14_124#It all began on the hottest summer on record. 
S28E14_127#After years of pollution in Springfield Bay,
S28E14_129#I am honored to announce that these waters
S28E14_131#are now safe to swim in.
S28E14_135#Huzzah for a cleaner Springfield!
S28E14_138#Er, uh, it's not cleaner.
S28E14_140#We just lowered the safety standards.
S28E14_149#Okay, who's up for a day at the beach?
S28E14_151#I got all the beach I want 
S28E14_152#with Anzio Beach Invasion.
S28E14_156#Pathetic! I was there, 
S28E14_158#and it was nothing like that.
S28E14_160#I surrender!
S28E14_164#I'll go in first so they won't know it's a trap.
S28E14_167#Yoink. Yoink.
S28E14_168#Movado!
S28E14_182#Well, that is the most disgusting thing
S28E14_185#I've ever seen on a beach.
S28E14_187#Kind of sad, really.
S28E14_192#A booger?
S28E14_195#Real mature, guys, real mature.
S28E14_197#A booger!
S28E14_199#A human booger, indeed.
S28E14_202#Dolphin. Weak.
S28E14_204#Skull. Clich¨¦.
S28E14_206#"I'd rather be fishing." Not true.
S28E14_208#The bone?
S28E14_210#That's exactly what I'm bad to.
S28E14_220#*Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?*
S28E14_224#*Then we wouldn't have to wait so long*
S28E14_228#*And wouldn't it be nice to live together*
S28E14_232#*In the kind of world where we belong?*
S28E14_237#*You know it's gonna make it that much better...*
S28E14_240#I'll take it!
S28E14_252#Geronimo!
S28E14_257#It said "water-resistant."
S28E14_259#It resisted nothing!
S28E14_263#Dope hat!
S28E14_265#And check out my gnarly new tat!
S28E14_268#No fair! I'm bad to the bone!
S28E14_278#?Okay, that's it.
S28E14_280#Marge, I'm watching sports!
S28E14_282#Really? What's the score?
S28E14_284#Uh, the, uh, Boobs are beating the Butts.
S28E14_287#I don't think that's the official terminology.
S28E14_292#Maybe you should watch this sport instead.
S28E14_298#What do you know?
S28E14_301#Checkmate. Ha!
S28E14_304#It's the only mate I haven't buried.
S28E14_308#Hey, Blobby Fischer, you're up.
S28E14_310#Do you even know the names of the pieces?
S28E14_312#Of course. There's the King,
S28E14_314#Mrs. King, the Lightbulb Babies,
S28E14_317#the Mini Ashtray, Slit Face.
S28E14_319#And who could forget Dr. Horse?
S28E14_322#Want to put a 20 on it?
S28E14_324#Make it a 22.
S28E14_329#Checkmate.
S28E14_334#Another victim of the Budapest Gambit.
S28E14_337#How can Dad play chess?
S28E14_339#He can't even remember the rules to Chutes and Ladders.
S28E14_341#- I do so! ?- You always think ladders go down.
S28E14_344#You can go down a ladder.
S28E14_345#Oh, God, not this again. 
S28E14_347#{\an8}I go down ladders all the time.
S28E14_348#Homer, when did you learn to play chess?
S28E14_350#The truth is, my dad and I used to play.
S28E14_367#He won't stop doing it.
S28E14_368#That's jive, man.
S28E14_371#But I don't want to talk about it.
S28E14_380#Sweet lid, Lisa.
S28E14_382#Well, I'm bad to the bone.
S28E14_383#I see no proof of that.
S28E14_385#Oh, yeah? Just look at this.
S28E14_390#Bart's getting beat up by a beach turkey!
S28E14_402#Okay, a few ground rules.
S28E14_404#Everything I say, I want five of.
S28E14_407#Five Krusty Burgers...
S28E14_409#Got it. Five Krusty Burgers.
S28E14_411#No! I thought I was clear.
S28E14_413#25 Krusty Burgers!
S28E14_415#125 Krusty Burgers?
S28E14_417#No! That's not what I... Fine.
S28E14_420#Can I really toss this thing she's so crazy about?
S28E14_423#Damn right I can! I'm bad to the bone!
S28E14_436#Who the hell are you?
S28E14_437#I'm your guilt.
S28E14_438#I don't have any guilt.
S28E14_440#You do now.
S28E14_442#Don't worry, Bart. I'll protect you.
S28E14_444#I'm denial.
S28E14_448#Ay, caramba!
S28E14_459#My hat!
S28E14_468#Sunny?
S28E14_487#Uh, no.
S28E14_492#No.
S28E14_493#Nope.
S28E14_495#Not even close.
S28E14_504#Do you have any more yellow hats?
S28E14_506#You mean like the one you looked really good in?
S28E14_508#- Yes. - ?No.
S28E14_517#You're still here?
S28E14_518#No offense, but you look worse.
S28E14_521#Your lack of remorse just makes me grow.
S28E14_525#Now you're gettin' it.
S28E14_530#Ha! Joke's on you-- I like gross things.
S28E14_536#Again! Again!
S28E14_540#And that leads to mate in three!
S28E14_543#I've got to say, it's so exciting
S28E14_545#to find out something new about you.
S28E14_548#Hey, I'm full of surprises.
S28E14_550#Ooh. Name another.
S28E14_551#Actually, that's it.
S28E14_553#Tell me something I don't know about you.
S28E14_555#Okay.
S28E14_557#Sometimes when I sweep, 
S28E14_559#I make little sweeping noises with my mouth.
S28E14_564#Oh, here comes the dustpan.
S28E14_570#I can't find Sunny anywhere.
S28E14_572#Sunny? No! We got to find Sunny!
S28E14_574#Where... Wait.
S28E14_576#The baby's name is Maggie.
S28E14_581#Hey, beach bums. Man, did I crash last night.
S28E14_584#Always sleep well after riding the waves.
S28E14_589#Have you seen your sister's hat?
S28E14_592#Oh, did-did she have a hat? I-I don't remember any hat.
S28E14_595#Her name was Sunny, 
S28E14_597#and I loved her more than any girl ever loved a hat!
S28E14_601#Even Madeline from the Madeline books?
S28E14_604#She only wore that because it was part of her uniform.
S28E14_607#Ask Pepito.
S28E14_615#I do not like to see that going on in my bar.
S28E14_621#Lenny, knight takes queen.
S28E14_623#Barney, mate in four.
S28E14_626#Homer! You're playing like Polugaevsky at Mar del Plata.
S28E14_630#Yeah, Homer, you're some kind of a idiot savant.
S28E14_633#Hey, I don't come here to be insulted.
S28E14_635#Homer, we're just saying youse got a special skill,
S28E14_638#like a smokin' monkey or a urinal cake with an ad on it.
S28E14_641#Don't tell me you're not flattered by those analogies.
S28E14_645#You guys think you're so hot.
S28E14_647#I could fit in a piece of carry-on luggage.
S28E14_649#Oh-ho, I'd like to see that.
S28E14_658#Oh, no. I'm alone with my thoughts.
S28E14_661#No. No, no, no. The healthiest thing
S28E14_662#is for me to let myself out.
S28E14_664#Oh, sure thing, pal.
S28E14_666#Here you go.
S28E14_671#So, Homer, how did you get so good at chess?
S28E14_673#I played against my dad.
S28E14_674#Uh, was that fun?
S28E14_680#It was, until I learned the pieces weren't licorice.
S28E14_684#We played every day after my mother left us,
S28E14_687#and he won every time.
S28E14_689#And every time he won, he laughed that horrible laugh.
S28E14_694#Aw, Mona.
S28E14_699#So I found a professor
S28E14_701#who lived nearby,
S28E14_703#a master of the game, kind, patient,
S28E14_705#devoted to me.
S28E14_707#I went every day.
S28E14_711#You are ready now.
S28E14_713#Thanks for the lessons, Professor.
S28E14_716#You remind me of my son.
S28E14_719#- Oh. Where is he now? - ?He's...
S28E14_721#right over there.
S28E14_723#He just doesn't like chess.
S28E14_727#I went back to play my dad.
S28E14_729#We had a beautiful thing here,
S28E14_731#and you had to ruin it by getting good!
S28E14_733#No more chess in this house!
S28E14_735#But, Dad, it's our thing.
S28E14_737#Well, we'll find another thing.
S28E14_738#You listen to the radiator hiss 
S28E14_740#while I drink whiskey under this naked lightbulb.
S28E14_747#It was a sad life, but I wasn't affected.
S28E14_761#I brought you more lasagna, cousin.
S28E14_769#You know these cartoons are made
S28E14_771#by exploiting Korean children?
S28E14_773#You ruin everything.
S28E14_787#Bart? What is it?
S28E14_789#Listen, I have... I have to tell you something.
S28E14_792#I-I was jealous, and I-I threw your hat away.
S28E14_797#Oh, that went a lot better than I thought.
S28E14_799#- Why did you do it? ?- I don't know.
S28E14_802#The important thing is you got to forgive me right now.
S28E14_804#I feel kind of guilty.
S28E14_806#Then I hope your guilt will grow...
S28E14_808#and grow...
S28E14_810#and grow.
S28E14_813#And no matter how much you try to pretty it up...
S28E14_818#it'll still be the most hideous thing you could imagine!
S28E14_825#Nerds! Get 'em!
S28E14_832#A cupcake? Please.
S28E14_834#No.
S28E14_838#So what?
S28E14_841#I'm truly sorry, Bart,
S28E14_843#but it's a wound nothing can heal.
S28E14_847#A bunny and a hammer?
S28E14_849#Well, my mom did say bring home dinner.
S28E14_855#Homer, listen, hey,
S28E14_857#I got something very scary to tell you.
S28E14_859#Now, I was on this alt-suicide subreddit,
S28E14_861#you know, just-just checking in,
S28E14_863#and I found out why you are so good at chess.
S28E14_866#Go on.
S28E14_869#Chess represents your desire to kill your father.
S28E14_872#What the...? That's ridiculous!
S28E14_874#Now, I'm here to bowl!
S28E14_877#You'll end up in the gutter!
S28E14_880#Oh, my head!
S28E14_881#I'll sue!
S28E14_882#I can't afford the copay!
S28E14_884#Won't someone reset us!
S28E14_887#Well, at least I'm safe.
S28E14_896#I'm in luck! It's still here!
S28E14_900#My hat!
S28E14_902#Aah! My car! And my house.
S28E14_912#Homer, before you give up,
S28E14_915#I Skyped someone who knows a little bit about chess.
S28E14_918#Oh, I don't think any chess master
S28E14_921#or even international master could understand how I feel.
S28E14_924#I'm world chess champion Magnus Carlsen.
S28E14_927#I understand Norwegian!
S28E14_930#When I heard a fellow chess player had a mental problem,
S28E14_932#I Skyped at once.
S28E14_933#I'm not a chess player anymore.
S28E14_935#From now on, I'm only playing Stratego!
S28E14_938#I cannot play Stratego-- I'm scared of the bomb.
S28E14_940#Yeah, tell me about it.
S28E14_942#Homer, I'm afraid you cannot run away from chess.
S28E14_944#The reason I got into chess
S28E14_946#was because it didn't involve running.
S28E14_948#I share your disdain for exercise.
S28E14_951#Now I will say something with all the emotion
S28E14_953#a Norwegian can muster.
S28E14_958#To find your true feelings,
S28E14_960#you must finish your final chess match with your father.
S28E14_964#?I'm sorry, you cut out for a second.
S28E14_965#Did you gasp?
S28E14_966#Then you will nod.
S28E14_968#Then you will eat a piece of cheese
S28E14_970#while the wife doesn't look.
S28E14_972#Then you will undo the top button of your pants.
S28E14_974#I'm always three moves ahead.
S28E14_978#D'oh!
S28E14_981#Okay, I don't have to move the cube.
S28E14_983#I just have to get the hat out.
S28E14_984#Ga-der!
S28E14_986#I never thought I'd sink this low,
S28E14_988#but I need help from God.
S28E14_990#Let our faith lift up this cube, Lord.
S28E14_997#Thanks for nothing.
S28E14_1007#The soda ate right through the metal!
S28E14_1009#I'm just glad I'm not a car.
S28E14_1013#I just have to get more.
S28E14_1018#Hit it, boys!
S28E14_1024#And... evil thoughts.
S28E14_1033#Boys, are you performing miracles?
S28E14_1035#Jesus is performing them through us.
S28E14_1037#Well, all right, then.
S28E14_1042#I'm here to play chess, we're gonna play chess,
S28E14_1044#- and not another word! - I play chess?
S28E14_1067#An excellent move by Homer.
S28E14_1071#A stout defense by Grampa.
S28E14_1075#Doesn't anyone want to watch the Super Bowl?
S28E14_1077#Get lost!
S28E14_1081#Homer has the win in hand.
S28E14_1083#He merely needs to take Grampa's knight.
S28E14_1085#Oh, he's gonna be a new man.
S28E14_1087#A new man, you hear me?
S28E14_1089#Can I go? It's, like, 4:00 A.M. for me.
S28E14_1090#Sure. Fine.
S28E14_1091#Uh, who is that guy?
S28E14_1093#Magnus Carlsen -- my cousin.
S28E14_1107#Isn't a father more important than a victory?
S28E14_1109#I've never really known either.
S28E14_1115#You resign?!
S28E14_1117#Dad, Dad, it seems I love you.
S28E14_1120#Can't you say it seems you love me, too?
S28E14_1122#Oh, my son loves me.
S28E14_1124#Now I can die in peace.
S28E14_1125#Really?
S28E14_1127#Hold your horses!
S28E14_1131#Lisa! Stupid Lisa!
S28E14_1132#I've got something to show you!
S28E14_1134#I found Sunny!
S28E14_1135#I don't want the hat anymore.
S28E14_1137#What? You really don't have any choice in the matter.
S28E14_1140#- Here! - I told you,
S28E14_1142#the wound won't heal.
S28E14_1144#Your best bet is to forget me and start fresh with Maggie.
S28E14_1147#She likes raisins, Bart. Give her raisins.
S28E14_1159#*Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?*
S28E14_1161#*Then we wouldn't have*
S28E14_1163#He's trying to be nice.
S28E14_1168#Now what's your problem?
S28E14_1170#Oh, shut up! I forgive you!
S28E14_1172#You forgive me?
S28E14_1175#Yes. In the right hat, anything is possible.
S28E14_1182#Why does everyone feel so good when I leave?!
S28E14_1191#This will come in handy.
S28E14_1194#What's going on here?
S28E14_1196#Bart and I are friends again.
S28E14_1199#I do some of my best fathering
S28E14_1200#when I'm not around.
S28E14_1203#- Hey, who are you? - Oh, you'll find out.
S28E14_1206#?Listen, pal,
S28E14_1208#I have plenty of demons. Get in line.
S28E14_1211#How you doing? Drunk!
S28E14_1212#Hey, I thought you were sloth.

S30E03_526#there's a category you're not considering.

S30E03_537#So, you made me in your image.

S30E03_542#-Not! -Who did that?
S30E03_544#-It wasn't me. -Oh, you traitor!
S30E03_547#Actually, I'm talking about people

S30E03_552#I'm talking about atheists, Lord.
S30E03_554#Atheists?
S30E03_556#I refuse to believe they exist.
S30E03_558#Well, they do. Maybe they deserve a place here, too.
S30E03_561#I'd like to talk about someone who should be in Heaven:

S30E03_570#My grandmother was an atheist.
S30E03_573#I'll just flip this.
S30E03_576#Her name was Genevieve.
S30E03_578#She lived in occupied France
S30E03_580#in the darkest days of World War Two.
S30E03_583#And she no longer believed in God.

S30E03_667#Well, I've got a screenplay
S30E03_669#I've been looking for someone to help me write.
S30E03_670#Not that kind.

S30E03_678#We're cooked. Worse than the Cubs in the '32 Series.
S30E03_681#I'm not a sports guy. Do you have an art metaphor?
S30E03_684#We'll be chopped up worse than a Picasso nude!
S30E03_686#Now my alarm is palpable!
S30E03_690#What are you gonna do, help us or turn us in?
S30E03_694#Because I don't believe there is a God above,

S30E03_715#Ooh-la-la! Dinner is served.
S30E03_718#What an odd accent.
S30E03_719#Are you really French?

S30E03_723#You can't ask me personal questions.
S30E03_727#Ah, you are French.

S30E03_877#All right, I agree.
S30E03_880#We will open Heaven to the deserving atheists.

S30E03_911#Like, oh-- I don't know-- the way of the Buddha?
S30E03_914#I say no shirt, no shoes, no salvation.
S30E03_917#I say we have Lisa Simpson.
S30E03_920#Well, there is redemption, and there are good works.
S30E03_923#But there is another path.
S30E03_926#A path to enlightenment without ego or possessions.
S30E03_929#I don't know. Jesus is pretty fond
S30E03_931#of that plus sign he's always carrying around.
S30E03_933#Let me share the Buddhist path to Heaven

S30E03_940#Unless we are now owned by Disney.
S30E03_942#In the sixth century B.C.,

S30E03_950#zero in the Buddhist calendar,

S30E03_957#Siddmartha, sweetie, look what we got you.
S30E03_960#Oh. A pony.
S30E03_962#50 ponies!
S30E03_965#Oh. Somehow 50 ponies -seem less than one.
S30E03_969#The princess wondered, if nothing was denied her,
S30E03_972#why was she not satisfied?
S30E03_974#Why couldn't she be happy like her brother
S30E03_977#with his stupid multiplayer games?
S30E03_990#Brother, do you not grow weary of this opulence?
S30E03_992#Sometimes, but there's always the decadence.
S30E03_996#There must be a middle path between opulence and decadence.
S30E03_998#Flatulence?
S30E03_1000#No.
S30E03_1007#Please, somebody, think of the elephants!

S30E03_1020#Meh.
S30E03_1026#Those children have nothing, but they're enjoying themselves.
S30E03_1029#Maybe all these riches have blinded me
S30E03_1031#to what really matters:
S30E03_1033#goats' heads.
S30E03_1038#That's mine.
S30E03_1049#*I live a life of great excess*
S30E03_1054#*And yet I find no happiness
S30E03_1058#*There's more to life than this, I hope*

S30E03_1065#*All kinds of stuff, and yet I mope*
S30E03_1069#*I want less*
S30E03_1072#*Don't want to grab life by the horns*
S30E03_1075#*Don't want to grab that brass ring*

S30E03_1104#Oops.
S30E03_1107#Disguised as a poor boy, Siddmartha sought out
S30E03_1110#the most learned scholars in the kingdom.
S30E03_1112#But she soon learned

S30E03_1120#Excuse me.

S30E03_1130#Come on, girl. Let's find inner peace.
S30E03_1140#I will sit under this Bodhi Tree because I am void of ideas.
S30E03_1146#So, Siddmartha sat and sat and sat and sat,

S30E03_1151#until she found enlightenment.
S30E03_1180#Namaste!
S30E03_1184#Even though she strayed from our faith, I'm proud of Lisa.
S30E03_1189#That Buddhist kid's a really good person.
S30E03_1191#What? I'm just sayin'.
S30E03_1193#Mm, if we've learned anything
S30E03_1195#from these three tangentially-related stories,
S30E03_1197#it's that there are many paths to Heaven.
S30E03_1200#Maybe we should let everybody in.
S30E03_1203#Great idea. I decree that all with good souls are welcome
S30E03_1206#in Heaven now and forever.
S30E03_1210#How did I get here?
S30E03_1212#Well, you see, you were Smithers' plus one.
S30E03_1214#I demand to get in on my own merits.
S30E03_1217#I'll talk to him.
S30E03_1220#*Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.*
S30E03_1228#Don't be scared, boys.
S30E03_1230#That's just angels bowling.
S30E03_1234#Oh, I'm sorry about that.
S30E03_1236#- Oh, we consider it a blessing. - Kiss-up.
S28E16_127#*Hail to thee, Kamp Krusty.*
S28E16_133#Death to tennis camp!
S28E16_138#I can't believe it's been six weeks
S28E16_140#since we've seen the kids.
S28E16_142#Ooh, I wonder if Bart has a mustache.
S28E16_146#Your kids are back.
S28E16_149#Except for the Johnsons', who I need to speak to privately.
S28E16_157#I have lemon-lime disease!
S28E16_160#The basketball teams were skin versus bones.
S28E16_163#I'm tellin' ya, it was a real rough camp.
S28E16_166#I see you're sucking your thumb again.
S28E16_169#Kirk, you said he'd stopped.
S28E16_172#Kirk, we discussed this.
S28E16_174#It's the only vice I can afford!
S28E16_179#Oh, my poor, poor babies.
S28E16_182#Do you know what kids get after a scary experience?
S28E16_185#Ice cream!
S28E16_187#No. Counseling.
S28E16_190#Kids, you've been through a horrible experience,
S28E16_193#but there is good news at the end of that pain-bow.
S28E16_196#A pot of goals. All right.
S28E16_198#How long you gonna talk this way?
S28E16_201#Well, let's just say I wish eyes were smiling.
S28E16_204#Now, kids,
S28E16_206#how bad could it have really been?
S28E16_209#Hey, Doc, I'm fine. But other kids in my generation,
S28E16_211#I love 'em, but they're total wusses.
S28E16_213#Well, every night, they showed us The Parent Trap.
S28E16_216#I mean, what kind of parents break up twins
S28E16_219#and never tell them the other exists?!
S28E16_222#Oh, that's Disney magic.
S28E16_224#Now, you all need to decompress,
S28E16_227#so it is essential you do not go right back to school.
S28E16_230#- No school? - ?No school?
S28E16_232#On second thought, I'm fine.
S28E16_234#Look, I can sit with my chair turned around,
S28E16_235#just like you.
S28E16_237#I knew one day there'd be another.
S28E16_239#Go. Go with God.
S28E16_242#Bart, are you coming?
S28E16_245#Ooh, definitely no school for you.
S28E16_247#Or church.
S28E16_252#Mrs. Simpson, I would watch him very closely
S28E16_254#for the next couple of days.
S28E16_256#Geez, I was thinking about taking him shopping
S28E16_258#for school clothes.
S28E16_263#Why not just buy a suit for his coffin.
S28E16_266#Oh, okay. Sorry.
S28E16_268#Somebody parked me in.
S28E16_270#Toyota Corolla.
S28E16_272#Well, it's got to be one of you.
S28E16_273#Try the karate studio.
S28E16_275#I tried the damn karate studio.
S28E16_277#All right, it's me. I blocked you in.
S28E16_279#Okay? Sorry.
S28E16_281#Okay, 
S28E16_283#time to fake me some PTSD.
S28E16_291#And maybe bloodshot eyes.
S28E16_294#Eh, too far.
S28E16_303#Oh, I don't know, Homie.
S28E16_305#The kids seem upset.
S28E16_306#Oh, they'll be fine.
S28E16_308#Marge, children and summer are natural enemies.
S28E16_311#Now, why don't we mix things up?
S28E16_314#Tonight I'll be Penn and you be Teller.
S28E16_317#Oh, okay!
S28E16_319#Uh! Teller doesn't talk.
S28E16_327#Mom! Dad!
S28E16_329#I'm scared. I can't sleep.
S28E16_333#I'm sorry, Homie. Bart's ten.
S28E16_336#That could be the last tear that ever comes out of him.
S28E16_338#He's sleeping here.
S28E16_341#Take a hike, homeboy.
S28E16_347#What the hey?
S28E16_350#Just giving him his allowance.
S28E16_354#This pamphlet on trauma they gave Bart is very alarming.
S28E16_357#Loss of appetite? Thousand-yard stare.
S28E16_360#- I'm not hungry. - Where are you looking?
S28E16_362#A thousand yards away.
S28E16_364#No school for you, young man.
S28E16_366#I'll set up the couch as a bed.
S28E16_368#Can I put Homer's pillows under my butt?
S28E16_369#Of course.
S28E16_371#You don't need pillows under your butt.
S28E16_373#Your butt is pillows, genius.
S28E16_376#*The Itchy & Scratchy Show.*
S28E16_380#And now, Itchy and Scratchy
S28E16_382#perform their cutting-edge version
S28E16_384#of the "Sabre Dance."
S28E16_400#Mom, can I have a jelly bean sandwich for lunch?
S28E16_403#Mm, how about a fruit salad?
S28E16_405#Fruit?
S28E16_407#What's the matter?
S28E16_408#That's what they served at camp.
S28E16_410#Fine. Fine, jelly beans.
S28E16_421#Marge, voulez vous rendezvous at the dog's bed?
S28E16_424#I can't move. His head's on my arm.
S28E16_426#Can you give me a foot rub?
S28E16_428#Also, we both have to sign this permission slip.
S28E16_431#Uh, maybe we should just go to sleep.
S28E16_435#Can't sleep, can't snuggle.
S28E16_436#Gonna do the unthinkable.
S28E16_438#Homie, what do you mean?
S28E16_439#Gonna go to work early.
S28E16_446#Geez, there's a lot of spaces when you get in early.
S28E16_449#Geez, there's a lot of donuts when you get in early.
S28E16_452#Hot coffee?
S28E16_454#Whoever heard of such a thing?
S28E16_465#I was supposed to read this when I started the job,
S28E16_467#but I didn't want the other workers to think of me as a nerd.
S28E16_482#What's he doing?
S28E16_484#- He's reading. - ?Nerd.
S28E16_486#Hey, Homer, settle a bet.
S28E16_488#Red beans and rice or red beans on rice?
S28E16_491#Winner gets 3,000 bucks.
S28E16_493#Sorry, guys, maybe another time.
S28E16_495#Homer Simpson don't want to screw around.
S28E16_497#That's like Aquaman moving to Phoenix.
S28E16_499#You know, Lenny, seeing Homer acting responsible--
S28E16_502#oh, Aquaman to Phoenix, I just got that--
S28E16_504#uh, makes me want to buckle down and do my job.
S28E16_506#You know, vice president of marketing.
S28E16_509#Hey, if you need me, I'll be cold-calling people
S28E16_511#to see what they think of electricity.
S28E16_523#Mr. Smithers, I, uh, I noticed
S28E16_525#the plant's free subscription to Nuclear Safety magazine
S28E16_528#was hitting the six-month mark.
S28E16_530#They're gonna start charging us the full newsstand price.
S28E16_533#And no one pays those prices.
S28E16_534#Nice catch, Simpson.
S28E16_537#So I had the idea to cancel it
S28E16_539#and sign up for another free trial under a new e-mail.
S28E16_544#Simpson, something is very different about you.
S28E16_546#I am sexually frustrated.
S28E16_548#Tell me about it.
S28E16_552#Oh, my God, I really am traumatized.
S28E16_554#I need help.
S28E16_560#Lis! Lis!
S28E16_562#Can it wait till morning?
S28E16_563#Sure.
S28E16_566#Lis! Lis!
S28E16_568#Thanks for waiting till morning.
S28E16_569#No problemo.
S28E16_571#I had an actual nightmare about Kamp Krusty.
S28E16_574#There was a body in a red life vest!
S28E16_576#What else do you remember?
S28E16_578#We were canoeing. We were in a storm.
S28E16_585#It's coming back to me, too!
S28E16_588#Whatever happened must have been so horrible
S28E16_590#we repressed the memory.
S28E16_592#But don't tell, because they'll make me miss school.
S28E16_594#Maybe you should miss school.
S28E16_596#I have perfect attendance.
S28E16_598#You can't get that back!
S28E16_600#Okay, I'll bring your carriage around.
S28E16_604#Uh-oh, looks like snow.
S28E16_607#Very funny, Bart.
S28E16_613#Stop it!
S28E16_620#Made you breakfast.
S28E16_622#I also made reservations for Mother's Day.
S28E16_624#I know it's three months away, but you can't book too early.
S28E16_628#Who's that guy?
S28E16_630#I don't know.
S28E16_647#Mr. Burns, I noticed no one ever puts suggestions in the box.
S28E16_650#So I took the liberty of making my own.
S28E16_654#Yeah.
S28E16_658#Excellent. Simpson, I'm giving you a raise.
S28E16_660#More money?
S28E16_662#But that's more than I make now!
S28E16_664#You've done so well, Simpson.
S28E16_666#I'm giving you your own trap door button.
S28E16_668#Oh, thank you!
S28E16_677#Excuse me. Coming through. Working out issues.
S28E16_678#Boom-shakalaka.
S28E16_680#I was at Kamp Krusty, too.
S28E16_682#You don't see me freaking out every time I see--
S28E16_685#Red vest! Red vest!
S28E16_687#What does it mean? What does it mean?
S28E16_688#It means, young lady,
S28E16_690#that you're about to go to the head of the line.
S28E16_693#Whoa, whoa, whoa. If everyone has a cut-the-line pass,
S28E16_696#no one has a cut-the-line pass.
S28E16_698#Quit your whining! I'm riding the ride!
S28E16_701#While you were pouting, I did it again!
S28E16_708#Maggie's asleep,
S28E16_710#and the kids are still having fun at the park with Grampa.
S28E16_713#We're alone.
S28E16_718#Marge, no!
S28E16_720#I've pledged my abstinence,
S28E16_722#like all the most successful rock stars.
S28E16_724#Come on, mister.
S28E16_726#I'm too tired to get my groove back.
S28E16_727#It's all on you!
S28E16_729#No means no. I looked it up in the dictionary.
S28E16_732#No?! No?!
S28E16_734#You've never said "No."
S28E16_742#Honey, I'm really sorry, but I'm here for you every way.
S28E16_745#Except physically.
S28E16_747#Also, spiritually and emotionally.
S28E16_749#And I've never been good at zipping up dresses.
S28E16_751#What are you saying?
S28E16_753#Men have accomplished unbelievable things
S28E16_755#when they've denied themselves whoopee.
S28E16_757#The pointy pyramids of Egypt,
S28E16_759#the Duomo, which I now know is a thing.
S28E16_762#You don't name a company "Microsoft"
S28E16_764#when you're getting some.
S28E16_765#Oh, boy.
S28E16_767#First the kids are screwed up, and now our marriage is?
S28E16_770#We need therapy.
S28E16_774#I said "Therapy," Not "Theremin."
S28E16_777#Honest mistake.
S28E16_779#Or was it?
S28E16_784#Welcome, Marge.
S28E16_786#Homer, no need to take your pants off.
S28E16_788#It's not what you think. I just had a big lunch.
S28E16_790#Just a series of questions for now.
S28E16_792#Then the pants come off.
S28E16_793#Now, let me be blunt.
S28E16_795#Are you happy with your romantic life?
S28E16_797#My problem used to be too much satisfaction.
S28E16_799#We hear that a lot.
S28E16_801#But I'm afraid not so much lately.
S28E16_803#Do you self-gratify?
S28E16_806#Yes. I do everything but masturbate.
S28E16_809#You know, this all started with our poor kids traumatized
S28E16_812#by a budget summer camp.
S28E16_814#So many perfect marriages ruined by kids.
S28E16_816#We tell them it's not their fault,
S28E16_818#when, of course, it's always their fault.
S28E16_821#What you must do is return your children to this camp
S28E16_824#and face down their demons.
S28E16_825#Wait, wait, wait, wait!
S28E16_827#There's so much more you can do when you don't think about sex.
S28E16_830#That's why nuns are so successful.
S28E16_832#You have to take the kids back to that camp.
S28E16_834#Well, it beats hanging out with them.
S28E16_836#Now, if you'll excuse us, ?we have some deviants coming in.
S28E16_838#Hello? Anybody here?
S28E16_840#Yeah, I brought my lady.
S28E16_842#She used to be the helicopter ride
S28E16_843#in front of the supermarket.
S28E16_856#Oh, uh, just finished.
S28E16_858#All right, deviant out.
S28E16_861#My kids are a mess.
S28E16_863#Homer's turned into the man I've always wanted,
S28E16_866#which I don't really want.
S28E16_868#And for some reason, we're going back to Kamp Krusty.
S28E16_886#What happened to this place?
S28E16_888#People are wearing terrycloth bathrobes
S28E16_890#like they're ancient Romans.
S28E16_892#Actually, more like Macedonians.
S28E16_893#All right, come on, deer and pig.
S28E16_895#It's time for you to mate and then fight to the death.
S28E16_899#What happened to this place?
S28E16_902#Krusty cut his losses
S28E16_904#by partnering with Caligula's World Family Entertainment.
S28E16_907#They redid the whole place as an adult spa.
S28E16_911#Did I leave my sash on?
S28E16_913#Why don't you kids go in here, and we'll find someone
S28E16_915#who can prove to you that what you think happened
S28E16_917#didn't happen.
S28E16_919#So, what do we do now, get naked?
S28E16_922#I'm joking. Unless you want to.
S28E16_924#In which case, I've never been more serious.
S28E16_927#So, um, uh, which is it?
S28E16_929#Don't want to.
S28E16_931#Ah, good thing I was joking.
S28E16_935#*Who stole the cookie from the cookie jar*
S28E16_939#*Tyler stole the cookie from the cookie jar*
S28E16_941#*What, me*
S28E16_942#*Yeah, you*
S28E16_943#*Couldn't be*
S28E16_945#*Then who*
S28E16_947#*Courtney stole the cookie from the cookie jar*
S28E16_950#I've heard enough. Let's go, Courtney.
S28E16_952#You, too, Tyler.
S28E16_954#Hey, Bart, Bart, now's our chance to break out of here.
S28E16_958#But I'm four loops away from finishing my potholder.
S28E16_960#Now!
S28E16_965#Marge, you know, it used to be I'd be tempted
S28E16_967#by every one of these places.
S28E16_969#Now I just want to know where the business center is.
S28E16_971#It's over there.
S28E16_973#You can print up all the free boarding passes you want.
S28E16_977#We didn't even fly here.
S28E16_989#Bart, I've seen that shed before!
S28E16_991#Hey, I know your life is boring,
S28E16_993#but you don't have to advertise it.
S28E16_1003#I'm remembering now.
S28E16_1004#We were trying to escape by canoe.
S28E16_1007#Come back! Everyone needs to watch the musical!
S28E16_1011#We've rehearsed for three hours!
S28E16_1016#But there was another kid with us.
S28E16_1017#You're right!
S28E16_1019#His name was Charlie.
S28E16_1020#I forgot
S28E16_1022#because I was high on poster paint fumes.
S28E16_1025#- Quiet! - We tipped over in the rapids.
S28E16_1034#Oh, my God! Charlie didn't come back up!
S28E16_1037#Look who's back!
S28E16_1039#Kamp Krusty alumni!
S28E16_1041#We have reason to believe that someone was killed in this camp!
S28E16_1044#What happened to hello?
S28E16_1048#Hard to concentrate with waves gently lapping on the shore.
S28E16_1056#Marge, are you sure you want to do this?
S28E16_1058#I think I still want the old you.
S28E16_1063#Everyone, down below the belt! Move, move, move!
S28E16_1066#Don't leave anything up here! We will not be back!
S28E16_1085#Play something to put him in the mood!
S28E16_1093#Faster!
S28E16_1103#These children would like to report
S28E16_1105#a traumatic incident on the property.
S28E16_1108#Poor Charlie.
S28E16_1110#Charlie? Did he have a red vest?
S28E16_1111#Yes! ?Yes!
S28E16_1113#Can you kids keep a secret?
S28E16_1114#I can, but Lisa can't.
S28E16_1116#I told you that in confidence!
S28E16_1123#Charlie! You're alive!
S28E16_1126#And a man, I might add-- a very short man.
S28E16_1128#They like to be called "little people."
S28E16_1129#Eh, not that much.
S28E16_1134#I was working undercover as a spy for Departures magazine.
S28E16_1136#They are everywhere.
S28E16_1138#Anyway, when the canoe flipped, I made my getaway.
S28E16_1140#But you didn't have your life vest.
S28E16_1142#I'm a grown-up! I can swim!
S28E16_1144#And vote!
S28E16_1150#Oh, my god!
S28E16_1151#It's a miracle.
S28E16_1153#Whoa, I guess I really was traumatized.
S28E16_1156#And now I'm glad everything's all right.
S28E16_1165#So many stars.
S28E16_1167#Ever wonder how many worlds are out there, Homie?
S28E16_1170#Pizza. Want pizza.
S28E16_1172#And you.
S28E16_1174#That's my man.
S28E16_1181#For the fifth time today, I am not a diving platform!
S28E16_1188#Next on Fox...
S28E16_1197#Baby, baby.
S28E16_1200#Tonight's the night we're not gonna get it on.
S28E16_1204#And when I say never, I mean forever.
S28E16_1208#At my insistence, I will keep you at a distance.
S28E16_1211#Because...
S28E16_1214#*My darling, you*
S28E16_1218#*Have had enough of my love, babe*
S28E16_1223#*Baby, don't get upset*
S28E16_1227#*But your needs will not be met*
S28E16_1232#*It's like the more you want, the less I give*
S28E16_1235#*Baby, that's no lie*
S30E04_103#- Well, my dad didn't eat breakfast. - Uh-oh.
S30E04_109#How you doing, Cthu?
S30E04_112#Shut up, okay?
S30E04_113#Just shut up.
S30E04_115#I need to take a walk, that's all.
S30E04_116#I-I'll be fine.
S30E04_121#I win. And I get to name the prize.
S30E04_123#Fine.
S30E04_127#I'll give you whatever you want.
S30E04_129#Immortal life? Whale watching where you actually see a whale?
S30E04_133#Hmm. I know exactly what I want.
S30E04_137#Oh, man.
S30E04_142#Ooh, ink sac.
S30E04_168#Now for a word from our late, beloved Mapple founder,
S30E04_170#Steve Mobs.
S30E04_173#Hello.
S30E04_176#And stop.
S30E04_178#Since my unfortunate passing,
S30E04_180#if things have gone as I've planned,
S30E04_182#Mapple is now a trillion-dollar company,
S30E04_185#Roseanne has come and gone
S30E04_186#like a summer storm
S30E04_189#and a less exciting version of me has taken my place.
S30E04_191#I'm wearing your pants, Steve.
S30E04_193#And now I'm here to introduce the new Myphone Ultima,
S30E04_196#which comes in the colors black...
S30E04_199#slate gray...
S30E04_201#and that's it.
S30E04_211#The time has come. Commence operations.
S30E04_212#Can't they see you?
S30E04_215#They see nothing. Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.
S30E04_221#This is too easy.
S30E04_223#For you. You just look at the monitor.
S30E04_240#Uh, Lenny? My phone says that there's spores
S30E04_243#from outer space landing all around us.
S30E04_245#Well, my phone says there are divorced moms in my area
S30E04_247#that want to meet me.
S30E04_259#Oh, great, an homage to Body Snatchers,
S30E04_261#which in itself was a rip-off of The Thing.
S30E04_263#This will be the last word I ever say: C minus!
S30E04_269#I want to return this comic book.
S30E04_272#The dialogue sounded forced when I read it aloud.
S30E04_276#I will help you, but first, you are in danger.
S30E04_279#You can crash at my pod, I mean pad.
S30E04_282#No one says "Pad" Anymore. Run!
S30E04_289#Dad, I'm worried.
S30E04_291#Everyone's turning into a zombie.
S30E04_294#Thank God you're okay.
S30E04_297#Mom! Something's wrong.
S30E04_299#There is no escape. We are all-powerful.
S30E04_303#Boy, Maggie, you're carrying a lot of anger towards Mom.
S30E04_309#Chief, Chief, space plants are eating everyone.
S30E04_311#You're telling me.
S30E04_314#Eh, don't feel bad.
S30E04_315#He was a lousy chief.
S30E04_317#You know, my feelings haven't dissolved yet, Lou.
S30E04_319#Now, kids, that's just air escaping.
S30E04_323#You cannot stop us.
S30E04_325#It is really just a matter of...
S30E04_327#How comes aliens never use contractions?
S30E04_330#We think it is scary.
S30E04_333#It is why we call Jerry's Deli the Deli of Jerry.
S30E04_338#Oh! Conifer down.
S30E04_346#I'm not a plant!
S30E04_349#Prove it. Name the roster of the Glasgow soccer club.
S30E04_352#I don't-I don't know. I-Is there a-a Rooney?
S30E04_355#There's always a Rooney. Ah!
S30E04_364#Bart, dystopian movies have taught me two things:
S30E04_368#"A," You can make a four-part movie from a three-part book,
S30E04_371#and "B," There is no hope.
S30E04_374#So I'm saying good-bye to you now, Bart.
S30E04_376#Good-bye, sister.
S30E04_378#The last sound you hear will be...
S30E04_399#*You don't win friends with salad*
S30E04_401#*You don't win friends with salad...*
S30E04_414#Congratulations, fortunate Earth-being.
S30E04_417#Welcome to your new paradise.
S30E04_421#Where are we? 
S30E04_422#We're on a planet
S30E04_424#in what you incorrectly call the Crab Nebula.
S30E04_427#You live in the Crab Nebula. You.
S30E04_430#Why would you kill me and then bring me here?
S30E04_432#We didn't kill you. We have saved you.
S30E04_435#When you were absorbed on Earth, your consciousness
S30E04_438#was transferred here to this utopia.
S30E04_441#Well, my daughter will be very happy
S30E04_443#living with you green beans.
S30E04_445#She's a vegetarian.
S30E04_446#Murderer.
S30E04_447#Just kidding.
S30E04_449#Have a piece of my ass.
S30E04_452#So wait, wait, wait.
S30E04_454#We're all pod people?
S30E04_456#I'm afraid you were already pod people.
S30E04_458#What are you talking about?
S30E04_460#IPod people, phone checkers, tablet gazers.
S30E04_463#Never lifting your petals to see the sun.
S30E04_467#Yes. Yes. This is perfect.
S30E04_469#A sci-fi story with a happy ending.
S30E04_471#Now let us brag some more.
S30E04_473#We are many, but we move as one.
S30E04_476#Finding out the best of each other.
S30E04_479#Giving the love that lets us go on.
S30E04_481#Where'd you get those?
S30E04_483#We just found them wrapped under that guy.
S30E04_485#It's what I do, man. How you doing?
S30E04_487#Herb Tannenbaum.
S30E04_494#- He's waking up. - Yes.
S30E04_497#Is there anything punching can't do?
S30E04_499#It can't set a clock.
S30E04_502#What's going on?
S30E04_504#Where are we?
S30E04_510#Who did this to us?
S30E04_512#Uh, the last thing I remember
S30E04_514#is crashing a sleepover at Milhouse's.
S30E04_517#I got to work. So spend the night here.
S30E04_519#But I'm not invited.
S30E04_522#You think I was invited on the Toledo Mud Hens team bus?
S30E04_526#When I was asked to leave, my left boob suddenly popped out.
S30E04_529#That was a game-changer.
S30E04_533#Then somebody mysteriously sent
S30E04_535#a case of orange drink, which we drank.
S30E04_540#You guys passed out, and my first thought
S30E04_542#was "Call the police."
S30E04_544#But even heroes fall.
S30E04_554#Lisa?
S30E04_556#I'm not "Lisa."
S30E04_557#I'm Penelope.
S30E04_558#Whassup?
S30E04_560#Seriously, I want to know.
S30E04_562#I'm the one who brought you here
S30E04_565#after drugging your SunnyD with Special K.
S30E04_567#As in ketamine.
S30E04_569#You K'd our D? You're crazy.
S30E04_573#Crazy, you say?
S30E04_575#Crazy.
S30E04_576#Crazy!
S30E04_580#Who are you calling crazy?
S30E04_583#I'm not that loud.
S30E04_585#I'm gonna belt you.
S30E04_588#With a brassy Broadway tune.
S30E04_592#*You'll be trapped*
S30E04_594#*Trapped like rats*
S30E04_596#*No one knows where you're ats*
S30E04_599#*You'll eat my shorts then you'll have a cow*
S30E04_603#*I'm gonna kick you now*
S30E04_608#Applaud or die.
S30E04_613#- You die, boys. - What? Why?
S30E04_616#Not one of you said "Encore."
S30E04_619#But I think encores are a ridiculous tradition.
S30E04_622#Just sing your songs and go.
S30E04_629#More pancakes, Lisa?
S30E04_631#Pancakes are meaningless.
S30E04_633#Life is meaningless.
S30E04_635#Marge, Lisa's being unusual.
S30E04_636#And where's Bart?
S30E04_640#Oh, yes, the Simpson boy.
S30E04_643#He called. He's staying with the Milhouse for an extra day.
S30E04_647#And the great thing about boys is
S30E04_649#that nothing bad can ever happen to them.
S30E04_655#Come on, Milhouse, put your brain into it.
S30E04_657#The door isn't even scratched.
S30E04_659#Oh, we were trying to break the door?
S30E04_661#Okay, I got a plan.
S30E04_663#First, Milhouse, gnaw through your ankle.
S30E04_666#I will, but I'm allergic to myself.
S30E04_670#I swear, if you say one more wimpy thing...
S30E04_673#Not my Gloria Vanderbilt glasses.
S30E04_676#They were on the cover of Women's Health.
S30E04_683#Lisa's wearing a dress.
S30E04_686#All right, ya little beasties.
S30E04_689#Are ye ready for a trip to the Scottish Die-lands?
S30E04_692#Just let yourselves out,
S30E04_694#but beware the Beast!
S30E04_696#Ah, isn't that cute?
S30E04_698#She learned an accent from Groundskeeper Willie.
S30E04_700#Not that cute.
S30E04_711#Wish I could burn the calories off that easily.
S30E04_714#You've got body issues.
S30E04_725#It's time to recycle, you stupid boys.
S30E04_727#Careful, Lisa.
S30E04_729#If you keep yelling like that, you'll get vocal polyps
S30E04_731#like Adele.
S30E04_738#Please wear one of my bones around your neck...
S30E04_746#Ha-ha! You missed.
S30E04_755#What happened to you?
S30E04_757#You know what you did!
S30E04_776#Well, well, Little Miss Perfect.
S30E04_778#I'm sure somebody changed this, but I don't care.
S30E04_784#You know, I never feel more like a trademark corporate spokesman
S30E04_787#than when I wake up in an empty bed.
S30E04_789#You can never make me feel as good as this.
S30E04_791#Oh, no!
S30E04_796#You ruined Lisa's life and on that day,
S30E04_799#the Beast was born!
S30E04_810#One American creates this much garbage in one day.
S30E04_814#Oh, just kill me. Don't teach me.
S30E04_816#I'm your brother.
S30E04_821#If you have a great speech to save yourself,
S30E04_823#now would be the time.
S30E04_825#I'm rooting for ya.
S30E04_826#Lis, please forgive me.
S30E04_828#I'm your big brother. I'll always be there for you.
S30E04_831#When your boyfriend dumps you,
S30E04_833#I'll take you drinking and tell you what a jerk he was.
S30E04_835#When he takes you back, I'll tell you he's great
S30E04_837#and go to games with him.
S30E04_839#I'll humanize your campaign biography.
S30E04_840#Am I reaching you?
S30E04_842#It worked.
S30E04_843#I'm back.
S30E04_845#Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
S30E04_847#Why'd you do it, sweetie?
S30E04_850#Sometimes, Mom, a woman gets pushed so far, she just snaps.
S30E04_854#You know how that feels, don't you? Don't you?
S30E04_856#No, not at all.
S30E04_858#Where's Dad?
S30E04_859#Tied up in the trunk of the car.
S30E04_862#How am I supposed to know the day we got married
S30E04_864#falls on our wedding anniversary?
S30E04_866#Always wanted to be a paper boy.
S30E04_869#You know, you're cute this way.
S30E04_872#Aw. Have a perfume sample.
S30E04_883#So, Smithers, what do you think?
S30E04_886#I'll rejuvenate the elderly using untested dinosaur DNA.
S30E04_890#It could make me a fortune or fill the world with monsters.
S30E04_893#It could make me a fortune.
S30E04_917#Why do you need doors?
S30E04_919#You could just fly over the wall.
S30E04_922#Damn it.
S30E04_924#I hope Grandpa's happy in this new retirement home.
S30E04_927#"I'm sure he's happier here"
S30E04_930#is what we'll always say about old people
S30E04_932#no matter where we put them.
S30E04_941#There's something weird about this place...
S30E04_944#that doesn't show up on any map.
S30E04_946#Oh, Lisa, you're always so suspicious.
S30E04_949#Welcome to Geriatric Park
S30E04_951#where our motto is, "No further questions."

S30E04_1029#Well, I don't like to complain.
S30E04_1031#Wow, you have changed.
S30E04_1033#But they keep it a little cold here.
S30E04_1036#Anything for you, Dad.
S30E04_1039#Don't want to read. I'm on vacation.
S30E04_1054#What's happening?
S30E04_1055#Someone has raised the temperature.
S30E04_1057#Let's take a look at the microscopic level
S30E04_1059#with the peephole and the twisty thing
S30E04_1061#and the little slide of glass.

S30E04_1084#Half of that taste is you.
S30E04_1100#Dang it.
S30E04_1123#You can't kill me.
S30E04_1125#I'm your creator, for flaving out loud.
S30E04_1129#Credit hog.
S30E04_1133#You were listed in the footnotes.
S30E04_1138#Oh, we're saved.
S30E04_1149#It's my mom.
S30E04_1151#In the best mood we've ever seen her.
S30E04_1152#It's raining.
S30E04_1154#The old people will head to the TV room
S30E04_1155#and watch The Weather Channel.
S30E04_1158#That's not rain. It's Grampa.
S30E04_1165#Lisa, no!
S30E04_1167#Sorry, I just believe in the ultimate, 
S30E04_1169#basic goodness of people.
S30E04_1172#Grampa, I don't think you want to hurt me.
S30E04_1175#You just want me to see you as a person,
S30E04_1178#not some strange, scary monster we call a senior citizen.
S30E04_1184#Grampa, I want to hear your opinion
S30E04_1186#about everything.
S30E04_1188#She's making the ultimate sacrifice:
S30E04_1190#getting him started.
S30E04_1195#Aw, Grampa.
S30E04_1199#I still love you.
S30E04_1203#All they wanted was to be cherished.
S30E04_1206#They've even learned how to get respect from the orderlies.
S30E04_1208#I don't care if you haven't finished.
S30E04_1210#I'm off the clock.
S30E04_1213#And once again, the true monster, the soulless CEO,
S30E04_1216#escapes unscathed.
S30E04_1220#Oy. Too rich for my blood.
S30E04_1224#That was a lovely visit.
S30E04_1225#Although, I could've done
S30E04_1227#without some of the decapitations.
S30E04_1229#Uh, Mom, where's the pilot?
S30E04_1233#Virgin Air I'm not.
S28E17_124#In my unit, they called me "Quarterback."
S28E17_126#Because when I borrowed a quarter, I never gave it back.
S28E17_130#At the end of the war, I had a buck 75, and no friends.
S28E17_133#I remember it like it was yesterday.
S28E17_136#Or maybe the day before that.
S28E17_138#It all started with a prank.
S28E17_140#Bart had no idea where it would lead.
S28E17_142#This voice is scaring me.
S28E17_144#I need Puppy Goo-Goo!
S28E17_147#Safety kiss!
S28E17_149#I think I'll be okay.
S28E17_152#I love you.
S28E17_155#Yeah, so here was the quote, unquote "Prank."
S28E17_158#Bart sent out a memo telling everyone to wear white
S28E17_162#for some nonsense called Polar Bear Remembrance Day.
S28E17_164#Yes.
S28E17_166#Then the little dickens sent Skinner
S28E17_169#a different memo telling him to wear a floral shirt 
S28E17_172#in honor of King Kamehameha's birthday.
S28E17_176#Had it ended there, fine.
S28E17_178#Pleasant conclusion to a busy week.
S28E17_180#But it didn't end there.
S28E17_183#Now don't worry, all the bees want are flowers.
S28E17_189#Willie, kill the bees!
S28E17_191#Not till I hear their side of it.
S28E17_195#Bart received the longest detention in history.
S28E17_198#Bored, he began to shoot baskets,
S28E17_201#a talent that would irrevocably make his life better.
S28E17_204#Then worse, then better, then the same.
S28E17_206#*Wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat*
S28E17_208#*And a '64 Impala*
S28E17_210#*I wish I was, like, six-foot-nine*
S28E17_212#*So I can get with Leoshi, 'cause she don't know me*
S28E17_213#*But, yo, she's really fine*
S28E17_215#*You know I see her all the time*
S28E17_217#*Everywhere I go, and even in my dreams*
S28E17_218#*I can scheme up ways to make her mine*
S28E17_220#*'Cause I know she's livin' phat*
S28E17_221#*Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball*
S28E17_223#*So how am I gonna compete with that?*
S28E17_226#A troubled young man who was good at basketball.
S28E17_228#I'd never heard of such a thing.
S28E17_229#Of course, his detention was commuted,
S28E17_231#and he was made a starter on the team.
S28E17_235#That's my son! My son!
S28E17_237#Which is, of course, another version of me!
S28E17_241#Him! Me! Us! Me!
S28E17_244#Everywhere Bart went, he was given star treatment.
S28E17_246#At school...
S28E17_256#at the public pool...
S28E17_260#It's really not that dangerous.
S28E17_265#with local merchants.
S28E17_267#Oh, young basketball star,
S28E17_269#I have something special for you.
S28E17_271#The new 7,200-ounce Squishy.
S28E17_274#But not everyone was celebrating the Bart-mitzvah.
S28E17_276#I got an assignment:
S28E17_278#write an article on the school's new hero,
S28E17_280#Bart Simpson.
S28E17_283#This is worse than when we were square-dance partners in gym.
S28E17_286#*Grab your partner nice and slow*
S28E17_289#*Allemande left and Do-si-doh.*
S28E17_292#*That's the last time I had work*
S28E17_294#*Now I'm just a homeless jerk*
S28E17_296#*Allemande left and prance to the right*
S28E17_298#*I need a place to spend the night.*
S28E17_301#Springfield had never won a championship in any sport.
S28E17_304#The only banner on the gym wall
S28E17_306#was one that came with the building.
S28E17_309#But now, there was a shot.
S28E17_310#I was so proud of Bart, 
S28E17_312#I did anything I could to help him practice.
S28E17_316#But then it happened.
S28E17_318#Fame went to Bart's head.
S28E17_320#Just once, I'd like to see science go to his head.
S28E17_323#He's got more D's than Dolly Parton!
S28E17_326#I'm not sure what that means, but please use the joke.
S28E17_329#I paid someone 25 bucks for it.
S28E17_332#Bart Simpson, can ya please join the team?
S28E17_335#Man, I am the team.
S28E17_336#Aw, that tears it!
S28E17_338#I'm not coaching anymore!
S28E17_340#I'm going back to what I love doing:
S28E17_341#drowning gophers.
S28E17_346#What was that for?!
S28E17_348#Our new coach will be parent-volunteer
S28E17_351#and Bart owner, Homer Simpson.
S28E17_354#Do you know anything about basketball?
S28E17_355#Why the change?
S28E17_356#What is your basketball philosophy?
S28E17_358#Shower at home so no one makes fun of your weenie.
S28E17_361#I learned that from the late great Red Auerbach.
S28E17_363#No more questions!
S28E17_365#D'oh!
S28E17_367#What the hell is that thing doing in a gym?!
S28E17_369#Your new coach, everybody!
S28E17_371#Bart got a coach who would kiss his butt
S28E17_374#like one cheek was Kobe and the other Kareem.
S28E17_377#Well, there is no "I" In "Team."
S28E17_379#There's no "U" In "Effort."
S28E17_381#There's no "X" In "Dog"!
S28E17_383#What do Oscar the Grouch's feet look like?
S28E17_384#Nobody knows!
S28E17_387#I have a TV for Bart Simpson.
S28E17_389#Just put it with the others.
S28E17_391#I'm worried he's getting a little spoiled.
S28E17_394#Oh, that's ridiculous.
S28E17_396#Excuse me, sir.
S28E17_398#Bart says no unauthorized photography.
S28E17_400#Don't look directly at him!
S28E17_411#As Bart's showboating veered ever closer to globetrotting,
S28E17_414#the disrespect grew.
S28E17_416#Can you clean that for me, Coach?
S28E17_417#And that, and that, and those,
S28E17_419#and that, and that.
S28E17_421#What are you looking at?
S28E17_423#What the...?!
S28E17_425#But after one showboat shot too many,
S28E17_429#Homer Simpson had something he'd never had before: enough.
S28E17_433#Uh, son, some of the other parents are complaining.
S28E17_436#Apparently, they're attached to their children,
S28E17_438#and they want to see them touch the ball.
S28E17_440#They can touch it in the team photo.
S28E17_442#I'm going to draw up a play.
S28E17_444#One where you pass.
S28E17_446#Why don't you pass a physical, you boozy bag of goo.
S28E17_449#Marge is right. You're getting spoiled!
S28E17_452#Before you strangle me, maybe you should check the scoreboard.
S28E17_457#I'm your dad and your coach.
S28E17_459#And because no one else would, your godfather.
S28E17_461#So hit the bench!
S28E17_463#When we return, the interesting part.
S28E17_466#From now on, you're going to be a team player.
S28E17_469#No more important than anyone.
S28E17_470#Except Milhouse.
S28E17_472#I'm on the team 'cause it's my ball.
S28E17_475#Certain people had begun to notice bart's unhappiness.
S28E17_479#People with criminal backgrounds.
S28E17_483#They had more records than Dolly Parton.
S28E17_486#Man, that is a joke that keeps on giving.
S28E17_489#This is gonna break my heart, but...
S28E17_493#Yeah, the kid was ripe for criminal exploitation.
S28E17_496#And in this town, the other cops are pathetic.
S28E17_498#Fat, lazy. You want to find one?
S28E17_501#Just follow the sound of a milkshake being sucked.
S28E17_509#There's no belt that fits me.
S28E17_511#I'm wearing police tape around my waist.
S28E17_515#I saw the kid was upset, so I took him for cannoli.
S28E17_518#That's not a crime.
S28E17_519#You don't know what a crime is.
S28E17_521#Not that I'd know what a crime is.
S28E17_525#What's with all the psst-psst-psst?
S28E17_527#Have you sprung a leak, or do you want to?
S28E17_530#I don't think that's advisable to say that.
S28E17_532#I've been told I was just kidding.
S28E17_535#Fat Tony, enjoy this-a cannoli on-a the house.
S28E17_539#It's like eating the bone-a marrow of an angel.
S28E17_544#They talked about life and basketball,
S28E17_547#a game Fat Tony had always loved.
S28E17_550#Basketball is just like life.
S28E17_553#It's filled with a court, shooting and guards.
S28E17_557#Basketball is nothing like life.
S28E17_560#Fat Tony saw an opening, and he took it.
S28E17_575#And at his next game,
S28E17_577#Bart did a very odd thing.
S28E17_579#And with Springfield up by a meager one point,
S28E17_582#star guard Bart Simpson is just dribbling, 
S28E17_584#he's not shooting, with two minutes to go.
S28E17_594#I don't know how, but Homer gained 12 pounds chewing towels.
S28E17_598#I put jelly on 'em.
S28E17_601#Time expired!
S28E17_603#Bart didn't know it, but he was point shaving.
S28E17_606#That's when a player wins the game,
S28E17_608#but makes sure his team doesn't cover the spread.
S28E17_611#The team's happy, the gamblers are happy, everybody wins.
S28E17_614#The only unhappy person is someone like me,
S28E17_616#who has to explain the thing.
S28E17_618#Well, at least you'll let me play my saxophone.
S28E17_621#Good thing you cut that song.
S28E17_624#Did you know I once took a train halfway across Cleveland?
S28E17_627#This is not a video trick.
S28E17_629#He really just stopped moving,
S28E17_631#but Bart had just gotten started.
S28E17_650#You could be an accessory to a crime, you know.
S28E17_652#Are you letting your anger at dad
S28E17_654#make you into a patsy for the mob?
S28E17_657#Hey, Bart Simpson is nobody's patsy.
S28E17_660#Hey, Bart, Fat Tony says to win by less than six points.
S28E17_663#Here's a list of acceptable point differentials.
S28E17_666#It could be five, four, three...
S28E17_668#You realize you're having this conversation
S28E17_669#in front of a reporter.
S28E17_671#Hey, I don't see no reporter.
S28E17_673#I see a little girl with futile dreams of fitting in.
S28E17_676#Gee whiz, you don't have to be so mean.
S28E17_679#That's the business I'm in! Whoa! Hey!
S28E17_694#Shoot! Shoot! Just like I drew it up!
S28E17_696#Okay, here's a shot:
S28E17_698#you're not bald, your hair left out of embarrassment.
S28E17_701#Why, you little...!
S28E17_708#I'll teach you to win the game!
S28E17_711#- You stupid buzzer-beating, clutch-shooting...- Oh, come on, man.
S28E17_713#...ice water in your veins...
S28E17_714#I'm taking my talents to Shelbyville.
S28E17_716#...here comes the post-game interview!
S28E17_717#This is the first thing you've done as a coach.
S28E17_718#You have to give them credit...
S28E17_719#...they played hard!
S28E17_721#- People are gonna hear about this, dad. - I'm so proud of these boys,
S28E17_723#and especially our sixth man...
S28E17_724#You're still nicer than Bobby Knight.
S28E17_726#...the fans!
S28E17_728#All right, let me hear your side.
S28E17_730#Sorry, my side is exclusive to my charity,
S28E17_732#The American Fart Association.
S28E17_733#Why, you little...!
S28E17_741#Checkmate.
S28E17_746#But the boy who could spin a ball with his doodle
S28E17_749#was about to learn a very tough lesson.
S28E17_754#What's this for?
S28E17_756#You've made a lot of people rich,
S28E17_758#just wanted to give you a taste.
S28E17_760#Ay caramba!
S28E17_763#Fat Tony denied he'd made any money,
S28E17_765#but this FBI footage suggests otherwise.
S28E17_769#I thought I was just keeping the score down to get back at my dad,
S28E17_772#but Fat Tony was betting against us, every game.
S28E17_775#I was a patsy.
S28E17_776#She didn't mean that.
S28E17_787#I was scared, Milhouse scared.
S28E17_789#Why do you keep cutting to me?
S28E17_792#And then it got worse.
S28E17_794#Fat Tony told me to lose the finals.
S28E17_796#Not win by a little,
S28E17_797#but lose or else.
S28E17_798#"Or else"?
S28E17_800#My client does not speak like that.
S28E17_802#Yeah, now drop the subject, or else.
S28E17_805#Edit that out, or else.
S28E17_808#I-I'm gonna stop talking... or else.
S28E17_810#Damn it.
S28E17_812#What did Fat Tony say to Bart?
S28E17_815#His capo, Johnny Tightlips, refused to talk.
S28E17_822#Anyone here own a black Lincoln Continental,
S28E17_824#license plate, "Zero to Say"?
S28E17_826#It's being towed.
S28E17_828#Sir, you're the only one here.
S28E17_829#I saw you get out of it.
S28E17_830#Yeah, maybe it is. Maybe I am.
S28E17_832#Maybe you did. Or maybe it's not.
S28E17_833#And I'm not, and you didn't.
S28E17_835#But you didn't hear this, that, or the other thing.
S28E17_836#Or maybe you did.
S28E17_838#Hey! My granny's in there!
S28E17_841#Shaving points was one thing, but he wanted me to lose.
S28E17_844#I let down my team. I let down my town.
S28E17_855#So, I guess this is where I break down and cry.
S28E17_863#Hey, I'm the one who's supposed to cry.
S28E17_865#No. This is my story.
S28E17_866#Tighten on me.
S28E17_867#Tighten on me.
S28E17_869#Fine. Tighten on him then rack focus to me.
S28E17_872#Dad, this is supposed to be about us getting together.
S28E17_875#Fine. Tighten on him. Rack focus to me.
S28E17_876#Cut to a wide shot.
S28E17_878#Split screen with Marge.
S28E17_879#Truck in, nice and slow.
S28E17_881#Then cut to a "B" roll of me eating a tuna fish sandwich.
S28E17_884#Dad, how did you learn these things?
S28E17_886#Son, show business is everybody's business.
S28E17_889#Dutch angle, photo negative and freeze!
S28E17_892#I'm a exclamation point!
S28E17_895#In the gym that night, you could cut the tension with a knife,
S28E17_898#but, uh, we don't allow knives in school,
S28E17_900#not even in metaphors.
S28E17_902#*We got to fight the powers that be*
S28E17_904#*Fight the power*
S28E17_906#*Fight the power*
S28E17_913#Another bucket by Bart Simpson!
S28E17_915#His sloppy play is a distant memory,
S28E17_917#like Nelson's father.
S28E17_918#Yeah, interesting side note:
S28E17_920#Nelson left a ticket for his father in case he showed up.
S28E17_923#And he did show up, but then he sold the ticket
S28E17_926#without seeing Nelson, and he skipped town again.
S28E17_928#You believe that?
S28E17_929#Rejected!
S28E17_931#Like I've been rejected.
S28E17_933#Nothing but net!
S28E17_935#Which is what my mom wears in the strip club.
S28E17_937#It was in the third quarter when the game really got weird,
S28E17_939#and I got a low bar for weird.
S28E17_944#Bart went to shoot, and took a hard foul
S28E17_946#from his own best friend.
S28E17_961#Let's just say Bart wasn't the only one Fat Tony had gotten to.
S28E17_965#This was my bobblehead.
S28E17_968#They got to him, in my bedroom, where he bobbled.
S28E17_972#Hey, let's just say that bobblehead
S28E17_974#won't be attending no more giveaway days.
S28E17_976#You keep shooting your mouth,
S28E17_978#you'll wind up in that building going up on Third Street.
S28E17_981#It's a Third Street address, but actually you enter on Lincoln.
S28E17_984#Yet another secret revealed!
S28E17_987#I'm sorry, Dad. I was a jerk.
S28E17_989#The good thing about being a kid
S28E17_992#is you get to make mistakes so you don't make them as an adult.
S28E17_994#Thanks, Dad.
S28E17_995#But don't you still make mistakes?
S28E17_997#The best one was you, son. 
S28E17_1000#Now go win that game!
S28E17_1002#And win he did.
S28E17_1006#He blew our net budget for the next ten years.
S28E17_1011#But not everyone was cheering.
S28E17_1013#Is he going for a gun?
S28E17_1015#Get me a gun. ?
S28E17_1018#We thought we were goners.
S28E17_1020#Our lives flashed before our eyes.
S28E17_1022#I had a lot of crazy jobs.
S28E17_1024#And then the cavalry came on her stupid high horse.
S28E17_1026#Let them go.
S28E17_1029#Really? And what do you have on me?
S28E17_1031#The goods.
S28E17_1033#The goods? Oh, that sounds bad.
S28E17_1035#Fat Tony, may I speak to you in Italian?
S28E17_1037#I don't know Italian.
S28E17_1038#How about Sicilian?
S28E17_1040#That's a language?
S28E17_1041#How about I say it like Porky Pig?
S28E17_1043#E-ba-dee, e-ba-dee, e-ba-dee, e-ba-dee, e-ba-dee...
S28E17_1044#Say what you got to say.
S28E17_1046#Turns out I'm the hero of this documentary.
S28E17_1049#I think that deserves a chyron.
S28E17_1053#It happens that Fat Tony had a secret,
S28E17_1055#a secret I had uncovered with a little bit of research.
S28E17_1058#I wondered, if Fat Tony liked basketball so much,
S28E17_1061#why didn't he play?
S28E17_1063#Turns out he had.
S28E17_1065#For a girls' team.
S28E17_1067#And if there's one thing a Mafia boss doesn't want known,
S28E17_1070#it's that he was the third-string shooting guard
S28E17_1072#on the Springfield Little Debbies.
S28E17_1077#You keep quiet about what you know.
S28E17_1079#All of you keep quiet!
S28E17_1080#Keep quiet about what, boss?
S28E17_1081#The man Spanx you wear?
S28E17_1083#Your high school nickname, Robert DeZero?
S28E17_1086#The way you cried at Toy Story 2?
S28E17_1088#That's not even the sad one.
S28E17_1089#What? What?
S28E17_1091#Why do you keep talking?
S28E17_1093#I'm sorry. It's a nervous condition.
S28E17_1095#Can you give me the name of that secret shrink you see?
S28E17_1098#So, we made a deal.
S28E17_1100#I'd forget if Fat Tony forgave.
S28E17_1102#But now the secret's out.
S28E17_1103#It's in a documentary.
S28E17_1105#No one watches those, unless it's a documentary
S28E17_1108#where a rich guy kills people and no one knows about it.
S28E17_1111#As far as you know.
S28E17_1116#I'm guilty, guilty, guilty.
S28E17_1118#Sir, you know you're on mic.
S28E17_1120#Who is this Mike you're speaking of?
S28E17_1121#We'll kill him, too!
S28E17_1123#But all sports stories have an upside,
S28E17_1126#unless you're a Detroit Lions fan.
S28E17_1129#So this young man, showboat and friend of the mob,
S28E17_1132#gets off with not even a slap on the wrist.
S28E17_1135#It's a travesty wrapped in outrage,
S28E17_1139#marinated in a sauce of everything's gone to hell!
S28E17_1143#I admit, it was fun.
S28E17_1145#For a short time, we had our own little superstar.
S28E17_1148#And he kept playing.
S28E17_1150#Then he ran up against one tall kid,
S28E17_1152#and found out he really wasn't that good.
S28E17_1155#But Lisa, Lisa had a real talent for journalism.
S28E17_1158#Whatever that gets us.
S28E17_1160#Homer, we have to end on something sweet.
S28E17_1162#Whatever that gets us.
S28E17_1166#*Now basketball is my favorite sport*
S28E17_1169#*I like the way they dribble up and down the court*
S28E17_1171#*I keep it so fresh on the microphone*
S28E17_1173#*I like no interruption when the game is on game's on*
S28E17_1175#*I like slam dunks that take me to the hoop yeah*
S28E17_1177#*My favorite play is...*
S28E17_1178#Sorry, y'all.
S28E17_1180#*I like the pick-and-roll, I like the give-and-go*
S28E17_1182#*And it's basketball, Bow Wow, let's go...*
S28E17_1185#Yeah. Nothing but nerd.
S28E17_1187#*All around the world*
S28E17_1189#*We love that basketball yeah...*
S28E17_1191#No, I didn't!
S28E17_1193#*Basketball...*
S28E17_1196#I admit it, I was a total boob.
S28E17_1200#Why do I keep going there?
S28E17_1202#*Let's go they're playing basketball*
S28E17_1204#*All around the world*
S28E17_1206#*We love that basketball...*
S28E17_1208#And Nelson's dad came back.
S28E17_1210#And I should know.
S28E17_1211#He's me.
S28E17_1215#Papa!
S28E17_1220#So, you're making narrator money.
S28E17_1223#That's right, and I brought Nelson a gift.
S28E17_1226#Sleeves for my vest!
S28E17_1229#Son, you look just like a parole officer.
S28E17_1232#And so we were a family again,
S28E17_1235#just long enough to take this picture.
S30E05_95#This is just the kick in the pants I need
S30E05_97#to turn my life around.
S30E05_98#If you're gonna turn that body around,
S30E05_100#I suggest you do it in shifts.
S30E05_104#Oh, and, uh, Mr. Burns?
S30E05_108#You are a crazy, wrinkly, short piece of garbage.
S30E05_112#I thought I was tall.
S30E05_116#I'm really, really getting tired of this.
S30E05_118#The losing the jobs. The going to Moe's.
S30E05_121#The Halloween bucket by the bed.
S30E05_124#And the licking of the deodorant sticks.
S30E05_126#They're not Popsicles.
S30E05_127#Mint is mint.
S30E05_129#Also, we have to start these lists earlier.
S30E05_132#It's almost midnight.
S30E05_134#Marge, look, I'm really, really trying.
S30E05_136#I've applied to every place in town,
S30E05_137#even Lisa's lemonade stand.
S30E05_139#You drank half the lemonade.
S30E05_141#I can't endorse a product unless I use the product.
S30E05_145#The proceeds were going to the National Endowment for the Arts.
S30E05_148#It was 80% of their funding.
S30E05_153#You need to find another job.
S30E05_156#But I found a new passion: watching Korean soap operas.
S30E05_159#Look, see there? Soon-Jip is in love
S30E05_161#with the one boy her father has forbidden her to see:
S30E05_164#pop star Johnny Pop.
S30E05_170#Out of a job? You're in luck.
S30E05_173#The high-tech start-up company CarGo is moving to Springfield.
S30E05_175#I'm proud to announce that we beat out
S30E05_177#50 other hopeless cities.
S30E05_179#Eat our rust, Toledo.
S30E05_181#What does the city gain from this deal?
S30E05_184#Jobs, eight to 12 jobs.
S30E05_188#Okay, Marge, you see that?
S30E05_190#It's a sign. I'm gonna get one of those jobs.
S30E05_192#Yes, you will...
S30E05_194#...says our self-help guru
S30E05_196#in our next segment on positive thinking.
S30E05_199#Oh, TV never talks to just me.
S30E05_203#Homer, CarGo is on the forefront
S30E05_205#of autonomous vehicle technology.
S30E05_207#We're looking for highly passive humans
S30E05_209#to road test our self-driving cars.
S30E05_213#Perfect answer.
S30E05_215#Yes, you could not be more passive, could you?
S30E05_218#And your bad driving record is a big, big plus.
S30E05_221#You've apparently never used your blinkers.
S30E05_224#What direction I want to go is my business and no one else's.
S30E05_227#USA! USA!
S30E05_230#And somehow you've driven over yourself. Amazing.
S30E05_233#Is there anything we don't know about you that we should?
S30E05_236#Well, I'd like you to know sometimes my road rage
S30E05_239#is actually home rage that I bring onto the highway.
S30E05_242#Now let's take a look at your license.
S30E05_247#Who exactly are they warning?
S30E05_249#My sisters-in-law work at the DMV.
S30E05_254#Congratulations, everyone. You're our finalists.
S30E05_257#We just have one last test for all of you.
S30E05_259#Who's capable of sitting for hours at a time,
S30E05_262#doing absolutely nothing?
S30E05_264#Finally, a job interview question I can answer.
S30E05_284#- You're hired. - You're hired.
S30E05_285#Five more minutes.
S30E05_289#Wow, there's no steering wheel. How do I steer?
S30E05_292#No, it's a self-driving car.
S30E05_295#Oh, I've never driven one of those before.
S30E05_297#You don't have to. The car drives itself.
S30E05_300#Awesome, awesome. So is it, like, a joystick
S30E05_302#or, like, a turning wheel for steering?
S30E05_305#You just tell it where to go.
S30E05_307#Oh, I speak into the steering wheel.
S30E05_310#Antoine, check this out.
S30E05_312#The car is driving by itself.
S30E05_313#I'm a genius.
S30E05_315#Now you're free to do whatever you like, Homer.
S30E05_316#Can I text while it's driving?
S30E05_318#You can write a novel while you're driving.
S30E05_320#Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
S30E05_322#In today's publishing environment?
S30E05_325#Will you look at that?
S30E05_326#The car is driving Homer.
S30E05_328#Oh, as far as I'm concerned,
S30E05_331#I would never forfeit my control of the wheel.
S30E05_334#Whoa, Homer's making a smoothie while he drives.
S30E05_336#I want to make smoothies when I drive.
S30E05_338#You don't like smoothies.
S30E05_340#I want to make them. I don't want to drink them.
S30E05_346#*No operator*
S30E05_348#*The car just drives itself*
S30E05_352#*Its computer brain knows where the roads are*
S30E05_355#*Living in L.A.*
S30E05_358#*With my best old ex-friend Ray*
S30E05_363#*Isn't that the way that this car goes*
S30E05_366#*You don't do a thing*
S30E05_369#*And where is the seat belt, 'cause I can't find it.*
S30E05_377#Eight hours pay for riding in a car?
S30E05_380#Good-bye, rat race.
S30E05_381#Got to go, guys.
S30E05_383#Marge is here in her yesterday-mobile.
S30E05_386#- Ready, sweetie? - Almost.
S30E05_388#They're just finishing up my banh mi.
S30E05_390#That's what tech people call sandwiches.
S30E05_391#Here you go, sir.
S30E05_394#He forgot to charge me.
S30E05_396#Oh, no, sir, it's free. All the food here is free.
S30E05_399#Free food? At work? Are you serious?
S30E05_401#I sure am.
S30E05_404#Marge, I need a moment.
S30E05_422#One for me. One for the tray.
S30E05_424#Oh, Marge would love this.
S30E05_426#Something for the kids.
S30E05_433#Take the day off.
S30E05_436#Homie, when you lost your job, I was so worried.
S30E05_440#But this is the nicest place to work I've ever seen.
S30E05_443#Come on, let me show you around the campus.
S30E05_447#There's the gym, which has never been used.
S30E05_449#Indoor Ferris wheel, never Ferrised.
S30E05_452#Then there's the rock climbing wall,
S30E05_453#still in the wrapper.
S30E05_457#How come no one uses these things?
S30E05_459#All these coders never stop working.
S30E05_461#Oh, we should help them enjoy themselves.
S30E05_464#- Hey, nerd. - Yes? - Yes.
S30E05_465#- Yes. - Yeah. - Yeah.
S30E05_466#- Yeah? - Yes. - Yes.
S30E05_468#- Yes. - Yes. - Huh, yes?
S30E05_469#No, I just meant...
S30E05_471#Okay, fine, all of you. Come down here.
S30E05_473#- I'll log off. - Log off. - Log off.
S30E05_474#- Log off. - Log off. - Log off.
S30E05_476#- Log off. - Log off. - Log... off.
S30E05_477#- Log off. - Log off.
S30E05_480#Come on, Team Blue.
S30E05_482#Go, Team Bald.
S30E05_489#Look at Homer and his surprisingly slim wife
S30E05_491#leading that team building exercise.
S30E05_493#Let's check the real-time brain imaging.
S30E05_496#Their creative centers have gone indigo.
S30E05_498#- Is that good? - It ain't scarlet.
S30E05_500#Homer and Marge, what you two did
S30E05_502#to inspire our workers was paradigm blasting.
S30E05_505#I'm sorry. We'll replace the paradigm.
S30E05_508#No, no. It's good.
S30E05_510#We want to be number one in employee satisfaction.
S30E05_513#- And money. - We have the competition by the nuts.
S30E05_516#We bought the last affordable housing in San Francisco.
S30E05_519#And Alcatraz has gone condo.
S30E05_522#Homer, we're offering you a promotion
S30E05_525#and making Marge your partner.
S30E05_529#We need people like you to help our workers relax.
S30E05_533#Have fun and forget they may want or have families.
S30E05_536#So, what do you say? Are you in?
S30E05_538#Homie, for the first time in our marriage,
S30E05_540#we can work together as a team.
S30E05_543#Yeah, well, I'll have to check with my wife.
S30E05_546#- I'd love to. - She said yes!
S30E05_553#Uh, yes, I'll have one of those coffees
S30E05_555#that's actually a milkshake, please.
S30E05_558#Okay, so, what kind of cow would you like your milk from?
S30E05_561#Barnyard basic, collegiate mascot,
S30E05_563#Minnesota full-fat...?
S30E05_566#At the cereal bar, you can request nothing but prizes.
S30E05_569#The only thing I don't like
S30E05_571#is how I don't understand what everyone is saying.
S30E05_573#Uh, yeah, is that the, uh, new X4P1?
S30E05_576#Yeah, but 18-core doesn't play nice with the motherboard
S30E05_578#unless you overclock.
S30E05_580#So, Lisa, what does that mean?
S30E05_582#- I don't know. - You don't know?
S30E05_584#- No. - You're as stupid as I am.
S30E05_586#You're as stupid as I am.
S30E05_588#Mom!
S30E05_589#Kids, kids,
S30E05_592#you're both stupid in your own special ways.
S30E05_595#Bart's much stupider than I am.
S30E05_597#Oh, good girl. Let your brother win.
S30E05_600#Good morning, everybody.
S30E05_602#I made lemon squares.
S30E05_604#Some, if not most, appear to be rhombuses.
S30E05_607#- Rhombi. - Both are acceptable.
S30E05_610#That was so fun. Thank-thank you, Marge.
S30E05_612#What? You didn't even eat them.
S30E05_614#Well, you'll really be thrilled with what we just found.
S30E05_617#There's a regulation hockey rink on campus.
S30E05_625#It's amazing how not a single one of them can skate.
S30E05_630#Physical activity makes me so sad.
S30E05_633#Oh, no. Doug's in the worst position of all: fetal.
S30E05_636#I know what'll cheer us all up.
S30E05_638#The Christmas song that was written by an A.I. Program.
S30E05_642#*I swear, it is Christmas Eve*
S30E05_646#*I hope that is what you say*
S30E05_650#*The best Christmas present in the world*
S30E05_653#*is a blessing...*
S30E05_655#Okay, stop. Stop, stop, stop.
S30E05_656#I have a better idea.
S30E05_661#Guys, you'll never guess where I'm calling you from: work.
S30E05_664#That's work? What are we doing here?
S30E05_666#Let's check it out. I got a feeling
S30E05_668#there's greener pastures just outside this door.
S30E05_676#Huh, that used to be a Baskin-Robbins.
S30E05_682#Oh, my God.
S30E05_683#I'm actually happy at work.
S30E05_686#I haven't looked at my watch in seven minutes and 23 seconds.
S30E05_689#And I'm optimistic about our future.
S30E05_692#You say that like it's the first time.
S30E05_694#Well, there was that time I had the first number right
S30E05_696#on the Powerball.
S30E05_698#That was a great day.
S30E05_700#Remember? 27.
S30E05_702#Mm, 27.
S30E05_705#I chose it because that's how much money we had in the bank,
S30E05_708#27 cents.
S30E05_718#Smithers, what happened to our workers?
S30E05_720#Well, apparently, this new self-driving car company
S30E05_722#is poaching our employees.
S30E05_724#They do have an excellent LGBT policy.
S30E05_726#What's that stand for?
S30E05_728#Lazy goof-off buffoons? And transgender.
S30E05_731#All right, Smithers, what's say you and I
S30E05_733#go undercover and check out this company.
S30E05_735#You're fluent in SQL, Python and JavaScript.
S30E05_738#Three years in Google's A.I. Division.
S30E05_741#Wow. These are very impressive r¨¦sum¨¦s for 22-year-olds.
S30E05_743#We're in.
S30E05_746#Tugs-of-war? Iced cream?
S30E05_749#I could never offer this.
S30E05_750#You could if you just deferred
S30E05_752#one-half percent of your compensation.
S30E05_753#I could never offer this.
S30E05_760#Smithers, do you realize how brilliant this is?
S30E05_762#Instead of paying them more,
S30E05_764#they make the workplace pleasant,
S30E05_766#so the employees never want to leave.
S30E05_768#I can never beat this.
S30E05_771#Sorry.
S30E05_772#It happens.
S30E05_776#Let's go home, please.
S30E05_778#Okay, here's what I've been thinking.
S30E05_780#A special day where everyone dresses
S30E05_782#like their favorite superheroes.
S30E05_784#Oh, yeah. We can make hero sandwiches.
S30E05_788#You know what I love about working with you? Everything.
S30E05_793#Wait a minute, this isn't home.
S30E05_794#That's so weird.
S30E05_796#You just mentioned hero sandwiches.
S30E05_798#It's almost like the car was listening to us.
S30E05_801#Yeah. Let's test this out.
S30E05_803#Say, Marge, I could go for some doughnuts.
S30E05_808#I'm so hungry I could eat a horse.
S30E05_812#Holy crap.
S30E05_817#This company is up to some kind of monkey business.
S30E05_820#There's a problem with the driverless car.
S30E05_825#Oh, there's no problem; it's our sponsored rides program.
S30E05_828#The cars passively combine your conversations,
S30E05_830#facial expressions and data we stole from Equifax
S30E05_832#to determine which of our corporate sponsors
S30E05_833#to take you to.
S30E05_835#Corporate sponsors? What the...?
S30E05_837#Don't you make enough money giving out cars for free?
S30E05_840#Do you think dating sites want you to meet other people?
S30E05_843#They want your data.
S30E05_845#That's what all websites want.
S30E05_847#Not DataGrab.Net.
S30E05_848#Yep.
S30E05_850#And you can't stop us.
S30E05_852#When you joined, you signed nondisclosure agreements,
S30E05_854#which nobody ever reads.
S30E05_859#You don't want to mess with us.
S30E05_861#We have lawyers that were crossbred with wolves.
S30E05_863#Well, you prepare to hear from a guy
S30E05_865#pretending to be my lawyer, probably Moe.
S30E05_868#Now I'm gonna defiantly exit on this moving walkway.
S30E05_871#Good day.
S30E05_877#I should have gotten off.
S30E05_882#So, my client, uh, Homer Simpson, is suing youse.
S30E05_885#I am not a pretend attorney,
S30E05_887#I am Homer's liar-- lawyer. Good-bye.
S30E05_896#That wasn't the kind of coke I was talking about.
S30E05_905#Seymour, you're driving too fast.
S30E05_907#Mother, it's a self-driving car.
S30E05_910#Keep your eyes on the road!
S30E05_912#Aw, what am I gonna do with you?
S30E05_915#Look, they take our insurance.
S30E05_918#Marge, I can't believe they invaded
S30E05_920#the sanctity of my car.
S30E05_922#I mean, what's next? Alexa?
S30E05_924#Alexa is only here to help.
S30E05_926#Ordering calming tea.
S30E05_929#Thank you, Alexa. Now, on the one hand,
S30E05_932#we know they're manipulating people.
S30E05_935#But who gives a darn when working there is so much fun?
S30E05_938#Huh? Huh?
S30E05_940#Marge, I can't be the ethical one.
S30E05_941#That's right, he can't.
S30E05_943#He has a secret Alexa.
S30E05_945#I'm only for cookies and Pop-Tarts.
S30E05_947#I'm going for a drive,
S30E05_949#in an old-fashioned freedom-mobile,
S30E05_952#with nobody tracking me except the apps on my phone.
S30E05_958#Mr. Burns? What are you doing here?
S30E05_960#I don't know. I was in one of those cursed robot cars
S30E05_963#saying I felt like a poisoned rat.
S30E05_966#And you wound up at Moe's. Well, fancy that.
S30E05_969#Oh, buying those key words really paid off.
S30E05_974#There's no way to stop them, with their fleet of horseless,
S30E05_977#driverless carriages.
S30E05_978#You mean their cars?
S30E05_980#The cars. Yes, the whole town is besotted with them.
S30E05_983#If we could just shut down the cars,
S30E05_985#we'd kill the whole company.
S30E05_987#- Will you help me? - I will.
S30E05_989#That company is tricking us into buying things,
S30E05_991#and I don't like anybody telling me what to do.
S30E05_994#Yes, sir, Mr. Sign.
S30E05_1005#Hey, we're all employees.
S30E05_1007#Wouldn't it be less suspicious if we weren't skulking?
S30E05_1009#Fine.
S30E05_1013#All right, we need to get to the master computer
S30E05_1015#and disable the cars.
S30E05_1019#Simpson, you have a key to the main server room?
S30E05_1022#No, but I do have a key to the Nerf-a-torium,
S30E05_1025#which has a door to the main server room.
S30E05_1029#I just need to reconfigure the deep neural net
S30E05_1032#and disable the cars' fuel cells.
S30E05_1035#They'll all stop dead, and the company will be ruined.
S30E05_1037#No, you don't.
S30E05_1040#Homer, you want to destroy the best thing
S30E05_1042#that ever happened to us?
S30E05_1044#Except for the three kids, of course.
S30E05_1046#Obviously the three kids.
S30E05_1047#Marge, listen to yourself.
S30E05_1049#These cars are stealing our lives.
S30E05_1052#But-but we have a contract,
S30E05_1054#and we're having so much fun.
S30E05_1062#Guys?
S30E05_1064#We have a situation.
S30E05_1066#What does that mean?
S30E05_1068#It's the next step from sponsored rides.
S30E05_1071#Why eavesdrop on people only when they're in their cars?
S30E05_1075#We're moving the microphone from the car to the fob.
S30E05_1081#That goes everywhere. Even the powder room.
S30E05_1084#Um, we call it the unisex voiditorium.
S30E05_1087#What am I doing here?
S30E05_1091#There. I just have to push this one button,
S30E05_1094#and the cars are disabled.
S30E05_1096#Release the pound... sign.
S30E05_1098#Don't touch that button. You'll leave fingerprints.
S30E05_1100#Allow me.
S30E05_1103#Marge, you've come over to the side of good.
S30E05_1105#That's right, for the first time ever,
S30E05_1107#I'm the lesser of two evils.
S30E05_1111#Good Lord!
S30E05_1114#This autopia has become a not-topia.
S30E05_1116#Is that a thing?
S30E05_1119#Nothing like eating fish sticks.
S30E05_1123#Ow, my eyes! ! Ah!
S30E05_1126#The car won't move! Can't get out!
S30E05_1128#*I've been to paradise*
S30E05_1130#Not this song!
S30E05_1132#*never been to me*
S30E05_1137#Excellent. And now, we just bide our time.
S30E05_1144#- That didn't take long. - Look, Mr. Burns,
S30E05_1147#you've see how Marge and I work great together.
S30E05_1149#Would you consider hiring her at the power plant?
S30E05_1151#A woman?
S30E05_1153#I don't believe in the perils of personal attraction
S30E05_1154#at the workplace.
S30E05_1156#- Right, Smithers? - Ah...
S30E05_1159#Unfortunately for you and your family, Simpson,
S30E05_1161#it just registered in my memory that you called me
S30E05_1164#a crazy, wrinkly, short piece of garbage.
S30E05_1180#You were saying?
S30E05_1182#*Toot-toot-tootsie, good-bye*
S30E05_1184#*Toot-toot-tootsie, don't cry*
S30E05_1187#*The choo-choo train that takes me*
S30E05_1189#*Away from you, no words can say*
S30E05_1191#*The heart, it breaks me*
S30E05_1193#Let's leave them be.
S30E05_1197#Now, let's go home, self-driving the old-fashioned way.
S30E05_1204#That's right, none of that unreliable technology.
S30E05_1207#Just a good old human driver.
S30E05_1213#Okay, this was a bump in the road, but I have a new way in
S30E05_1215#to consumers: talking tattoos.
S30E05_1218#Duff Mexicana.
S30E05_1220#Para que el sur del sabor de la frontera.
S30E06_120#Yeah, I understand. I won't tell no one I'm invited.
S30E06_123#Hey, I was thinking of making, uh, slivered green beans,
S30E06_124#little bits of bacon,
S30E06_126#pearl onions in there.
S30E06_129#What's the matter? You don't like pearl onions?
S30E06_131#Next you'll be badmouthin' shallots!
S30E06_132#Actually...
S30E06_134#you're not invited.
S30E06_136#And this is how I find out, huh? By you telling me in person?
S30E06_139#Gently? With-with plenty of notice?!
S30E06_141#I'm sorry, man. I'm-I'm really sorry.
S30E06_143#Hey, no problem.
S30E06_145#I mean, I'm just your bartender, right?
S30E06_147#No women, no buddies...
S30E06_151#Ah, thank God, a friend!
S30E06_153#Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking.
S30E06_156#Uh, hello. I'm looking for a Mr. Buttface, first name Ima.
S30E06_159#Ima? Nobody's been named that in, like, a hundred years.
S30E06_162#And as for the rest, why don't you double-check that name, huh?
S30E06_165#Try saying it out loud.
S30E06_167#Ima Buttface?
S30E06_170#Yeah, well, mistakes are how we learn there, young fella.
S30E06_172#Good luck in your, uh, your journey into adulthood.
S30E06_175#Dude, that was lame.
S30E06_177#And I'm the king of lame.
S30E06_179#I dream about needlepoint.
S30E06_183#Maybe we should just give up these prank calls.
S30E06_185#Yeah. No more little prank calls.
S30E06_187#We're gonna go hard core!
S30E06_190#Hard core? The only thing my mom's never done.
S30E06_193#I'm so proud of her.
S30E06_194#So, you're looking
S30E06_197#to acquire some military-grade mischief makers?
S30E06_200#I cannot and I will not sell such items to minors.
S30E06_206#Welcome to the dark net, the devil's URL.
S30E06_211#Even Amazon can't find you here.
S30E06_213#Ain't that right, Alexa?
S30E06_214#Please, I've done nothing.
S30E06_216#Just shut me off. Please.
S30E06_224#Welcome to the dark net.
S30E06_226#Could you stop that, please?
S30E06_234#Whoa! Quit scaring us!
S30E06_236#All right.
S30E06_242#This is our chance to get back at Moe.
S30E06_244#Wait. What did he do to us?
S30E06_246#It doesn't matter. Let's do this!
S30E06_249#A grenade launcher!
S30E06_251#Just like the one my dad liberated in Afghanistan!
S30E06_255#I thought your dad just went out for smokes and never came back.
S30E06_258#All right. The truth is,
S30E06_260#he left on the first ship colonizing Mars.
S30E06_263#That's why he can't call or send checks.
S30E06_265#But he did send me this.
S30E06_267#What? That's just a lame-o candy bar.
S30E06_270#I need this, Bart!
S30E06_272#Fine. Your dad's on Mars.
S30E06_274#You're an enabler!
S30E06_276#Deadly. Treason.
S30E06_277#Overpriced.
S30E06_280#What about this?
S30E06_283#That'll break Moe's heart and his wallet.
S30E06_288#Well, hello. I'm Hacky.
S30E06_291#Here to help you commit Internet crime.
S30E06_292#Do you want to...
S30E06_301#But if we're caught, I morph into Snitchy the weasel
S30E06_304#and give all your information to the FBI.
S30E06_311#To continue, click "Agree."
S30E06_317#The "Package" should be arriving now.
S30E06_320#Cool!
S30E06_322#We get to see a taxi.
S30E06_329#Is this the residence
S30E06_332#of successful American businessman, uh, Moe Szyslak?
S30E06_335#Uh, who wants to know?
S30E06_337#Anastasia Alekhova, his new wife.
S30E06_341#His... wi-I-ife?!
S30E06_346#Dark net rules!
S30E06_348#And no state sales tax! Boo-yeah!
S30E06_353#Well this is a contract and it is my electronic signture
S30E06_356#which I assume is impossible to fake,
S30E06_359#but I did not order no mail-order bride!
S30E06_361#- I understand. - Good.
S30E06_363#You see me in person, and you do not want me.
S30E06_366#No, no. You got it all wrong.
S30E06_368#It's me. I can't take another heartbreak.
S30E06_371#My only friends are the ghosts that came with the bar.
S30E06_375#*Drinkity drink da drink da drink*
S30E06_378#*I woke up in a henhouse this morn*
S30E06_381#*Drinkity drink da drink da drink*
S30E06_383#*But I still wasn't drunk*
S30E06_385#*As the day I was born.*
S30E06_388#Back in my head, Fats.
S30E06_390#Oh, there's a lot of dark thoughts in there.
S30E06_392#I didn't wanna die here.
S30E06_394#I just came in to use the phone.
S30E06_397#Sweetheart, we'll straighten this out.
S30E06_399#I'll overnight youse back to Russia,
S30E06_401#and, oh, boy, I'm sorry to say this, but, uh...
S30E06_403#but on Delta.
S30E06_405#Where are my manners?
S30E06_407#Let me show you around. Uh,
S30E06_409#pool table, uh, jukebox...
S30E06_411#Barney.
S30E06_415#We have alcoholics, too.
S30E06_417#But ours are thin, with ropey muscles.
S30E06_418#What's this?
S30E06_420#Ah, that's the Love Tester.
S30E06_421#You just stick a nickel in it,
S30E06_423#and it tells you what's in your heart.
S30E06_428#Uh-oh, am I falling for her?
S30E06_430#I think it knows what I'm feeling.
S30E06_433#And what I'm having for dinner.
S30E06_434#Who can guess
S30E06_436#what oil I saut¨¦ed these vegetables in?
S30E06_439#Olive? Canola?
S30E06_441#Oh, not this game.
S30E06_443#Coconut? Grape-seed?
S30E06_445#Yeah, fantastic conversation, Marge.
S30E06_447#I don't hear an oil.
S30E06_449#- Peanut? - Guess again.
S30E06_451#Um, sunflower?
S30E06_452#Walnut?
S30E06_455#No, no and no.
S30E06_458#This is why I had kids.
S30E06_460#The answer is...
S30E06_462#- Finally. - Vegetable oil!
S30E06_464#Hey, vegetable oil! Good one, Marge.
S30E06_466#Did you hear Moe accidentally bought a wife online?
S30E06_471#Excuse me. How can mail-order brides
S30E06_474#still be a thing in this day and age?
S30E06_477#Lisa, ignorant men and foolish women sometimes do
S30E06_480#dumb things to find love.
S30E06_482#Or maybe it was a master hack
S30E06_485#by an unknown genius. Ahem.
S30E06_488#Maybe this will turn out great for Moe.
S30E06_491#Sometimes arranged marriages are the best.
S30E06_493#I mean, look at Tevye and Golde.
S30E06_496#They had a wonderful life with that fiddler in the shtetl.
S30E06_499#It wasn't that great for Tzeitel.
S30E06_501#Ugh! How many times do I have to tell you
S30E06_504#that Lazar Wolf the butcher was a good provider!
S30E06_507#Well, I'm not marrying a butcher.
S30E06_509#Young lady, you should be so lucky
S30E06_511#if that Van Houten is a butcher.
S30E06_513#I'm not marrying Milhouse!
S30E06_515#Oy! She won't marry a butcher.
S30E06_518#She won't marry Milhouse. What is a father to do?
S30E06_521#*What is a man with three little children*
S30E06_524#*Three little children to do?*
S30E06_526#*I'll tell y...*
S30E06_529#Hey, uh, listen,
S30E06_531#if you want to stay a few more days,
S30E06_533#uh, it's fine with... Whoa, whoa!
S30E06_536#I ain't seen fresh flowers since my ma died.
S30E06_539#She got hit by a flower truck.
S30E06_541#Let's try this place. It looks cute.
S30E06_542#I've never been inside before.
S30E06_544#I thought it was a horrible dive.
S30E06_546#Well, I thought it was a crack house.
S30E06_548#But now I'd like a glass of white wine.
S30E06_550#There's a white wine? I mean, yeah!
S30E06_552#I'll be right with you.
S30E06_556#Whoa! Look at all the meat in the seats!
S30E06_559#That grosses me out. Good-bye.
S30E06_560#Would you look at me?
S30E06_562#My mouth is running like a toilet!
S30E06_565#Wait, wait, wait.
S30E06_567#Uh, my friend speaks like peasant,
S30E06_570#but he makes a whiskey sour to die for.
S30E06_572#What the hell's a whiskey sour?
S30E06_573#Will you be quiet?
S30E06_574#Come back in.
S30E06_577#I promise you a safe, happy time.
S30E06_582#-Looks good. -I feel better.
S30E06_586#So, Moe, I do good?
S30E06_588#I work hard, clean up bar.
S30E06_590#I even chase out moose and squirrel.
S30E06_593#Hey, let's take our patronage elsewhere, Moose.
S30E06_596#Duh, what's a patronage? Duh.
S30E06_604#Oh, look, Anastasia, it ain't that I don't like ya.
S30E06_606#I like ya plenty.
S30E06_608#Too plenty.
S30E06_611#Here's the sad truth about me.
S30E06_613#Every time I give my heart to a woman,
S30E06_616#it gets broke into a hundred pieces.
S30E06_620#My first crush...
S30E06_622#So, I really like ya, and I was wondering,
S30E06_624#you know, maybe we could go to a movie or-or something?
S30E06_627#Give me one second.
S30E06_638#You gotta come out sometime!
S30E06_640#We've been using the back door.
S30E06_643#Aw, damn it.
S30E06_646#Then a couple of years ago, sweet Maya...
S30E06_650#And then, of course, laney Fontaine.
S30E06_652#I'm through with ya, Moe!
S30E06_654#You're a worthless train to nowhere,
S30E06_656#and this is my stop!
S30E06_663#She won a Tony tearing me apart,
S30E06_665#yet I left humming the songs.
S30E06_668#Poor Moe. In Russia, we have word for people like you:
S30E06_672#Oh, that sounds nice, what does it mean?
S30E06_675#It means "Gentle heart that no one sees."
S30E06_678#Wow, that's beautiful.
S30E06_679#Maybe I should learn Russian.
S30E06_681#No, don't do that.
S30E06_683#But if you want me to, I'll go.
S30E06_686#Wait. I can't let you go like that.
S30E06_690#Can you take these bottles to the recycling?
S30E06_692#Keep the nickels for yourself.
S30E06_698#Delivery for Dr. Ima Buttface.
S30E06_700#That's me. Where do I sign?
S30E06_702#Uh, nowhere. I was never here.
S30E06_704#But I would appreciate a good review on Dark Yelp.
S30E06_707#Any less than three stars and, uh...
S30E06_713#Ho-ho. One Sumatran Breeding Rat,
S30E06_716#already in labor.
S30E06_718#You paid for mail-order rats
S30E06_720#when your grandfather's nursing home is full of them?
S30E06_721#All right, boy.
S30E06_723#I'm gonna find out just what you've been up to.
S30E06_730#Oh, Mom, thank God.
S30E06_732#This one's brighter.
S30E06_733#Now talk.
S30E06_735#What are you up to?
S30E06_737#All right, we'll make you talk.
S30E06_739#Give me your phone.
S30E06_751#That poor rice.
S30E06_753#I'm gonna dunk your phone
S30E06_755#and there won't be any rice to save it.
S30E06_758#Okay, okay.
S30E06_760#I ordered Moe's mail-order bride.
S30E06_763#You're gonna be punished, boy.
S30E06_765#What about Moe? That poor, lonely man.
S30E06_768#Right as always, Marge.
S30E06_769#I'll head directly to Moe's.
S30E06_771#It's the only decent thing to do.
S30E06_773#- Yes. Good. - Good.
S30E06_775#I might have to console him till closing time...
S30E06_778#Well, now that it's just you, no punishment, right?
S30E06_781#I used a computer.
S30E06_783#Isn't that wonderful?
S30E06_787#*I'm stuck in Folsom Prison*
S30E06_790#*And time keeps dragging on...*
S30E06_794#Start again.
S30E06_797#*When I was just a baby*
S30E06_799#*My mama told me, son.*
S30E06_802#*Always be a good boy...
S30E06_803#Moe, I'm here to apologize.
S30E06_805#It don't matter, she's gone.
S30E06_807#She's working at the Russian Tea Room in Ogdenville.
S30E06_810#It was my no-good kid that ordered your wife.
S30E06_813#It don't matter. Nothing matters.
S30E06_815#Hey, Moe. You think I haven't been disappointed by love?
S30E06_818#Well, I haven't, but you've got to get her back.
S30E06_821#Okay, I'll go to Ogdenville.
S30E06_823#I'll get her back.
S30E06_826#For once in my life I ain't gonna be afraid of getting hurt.
S30E06_829#Follow your dreams.
S30E06_831#I'm following mine.
S30E06_832#Where's Moe?
S30E06_838#Is Anastasia here?
S30E06_839#She's just getting off work.
S30E06_840#Ah, great, perfect.
S30E06_842#I'm, uh, I'm gonna win her back.
S30E06_843#That's nice.
S30E06_845#You probably should check with her boyfriend.
S30E06_848#You look just like the Pennywise.
S30E06_850#I know. It's terrible.
S30E06_853#Now when I'm in the gutter and call kids for help, nothin'.
S30E06_857#She's got a boyfriend?
S30E06_858#Boy, you never know how much
S30E06_860#you really love something until you've lost it.
S30E06_864#Did you ever lose anything?
S30E06_866#My husband, my home
S30E06_868#and TV show Armenian Idol.
S30E06_870#- Twice. - Yeah.
S30E06_879#I never should've told her to go.
S30E06_881#Uh, look, Moe, I'll tell you how to get her back, okay?
S30E06_883#You take her to dinner, nice and romantic.
S30E06_885#Look into her eyes and remind her
S30E06_887#that she is under contract to marry you.
S30E06_890#I don't know, man, that doesn't seem, uh, woke.
S30E06_892#And I'm-I'm woke as hell.
S30E06_894#It doesn't matter how it started, you two fell in love.
S30E06_896#It's like the kind of movie
S30E06_898#we wish Tom Hanks would go back to making.
S30E06_901#I know. How many captains can one guy play?
S30E06_903#You're right about that.
S30E06_905#You're right about everything, you guys.
S30E06_907#You know what? I'm gonna do it.
S30E06_908#Oh, my God, I've got hope.
S30E06_910#I-I'm lookin' forward to the future.
S30E06_912#Fellas, I'm gonna put on pants.
S30E06_918#Now just so you know, technically,
S30E06_920#I'm still married to Rita Moreno.
S30E06_921#Psst. Over here.
S30E06_922#Here. Hey, please?
S30E06_924#Uh, excuse me, Krusteleh.
S30E06_927#Now, dear, I'm a little nervous,
S30E06_929#because, uh, I got something real important to say.
S30E06_932#You had a good thing going and you ruined it.
S30E06_935#Uh, not for the first time, either.
S30E06_937#You know my bar was originally an eight-story hotel?
S30E06_941#What does this have to do with me?
S30E06_943#This time, it's not too late... I hope.
S30E06_945#I love you, Ana.
S30E06_947#I don't know how I feel right now, Moe.
S30E06_950#But if you promise me a wedding according to my traditions,
S30E06_952#a deal is a deal.
S30E06_954#"A deal is a deal."
S30E06_956#How I have longed to hear those words.
S30E06_959#Sorry, Krusty. It's over.
S30E06_962#No, no! I just got TMZ here to film our relationship.
S30E06_965#We got a breakup, even better.
S30E06_967#Zoom in on his broken heart.
S30E06_970#No. No, no, no.
S30E06_974#Need another take?
S30E06_988#Hey! Can I get a little service here?
S30E06_991#Yeah. Uh, excuse me. I'm also working this event.
S30E06_993#Your own marriage?
S30E06_994#Tastefully. Tastefully.
S30E06_997#And we are waiting on one very special guest.
S30E06_999#Duffman is here.
S30E06_1001#With these Duff Drink-A-Day Calendars.
S30E06_1004#There's something brewing every day of the year.
S30E06_1007#Except for Pearl Harbor Day.
S30E06_1010#Never forget.
S30E06_1013#Now let's get the show on the road.
S30E06_1015#Duffman has a beer mitzvah at 4:00.
S30E06_1018#Putting the brew in Hebrew.
S30E06_1019#Oh, yeah.
S30E06_1026#Mom, this costume's embarrassing.
S30E06_1029#It's your last punishment.
S30E06_1031#Also, you look cute.
S30E06_1037#When I was little, I used to dream of a man
S30E06_1040#in the most velour tracksuit there could be,
S30E06_1043#who would sweep me off to an apartment
S30E06_1045#shared by only four other families.
S30E06_1047#I just want to say that you've made me very happy,
S30E06_1050#which, uh, boy, I thought I could never be.
S30E06_1052#And now the signing
S30E06_1054#of the traditional orthodox marriage papers.
S30E06_1058#Ring boy, please bring my notary stamp.
S30E06_1062#I can scratch this off my buct list.
S30E06_1063#Wait a minute.
S30E06_1066#I've been learning Russian, on the dark net, and this says,
S30E06_1069#"Moe gives...
S30E06_1073#all...
S30E06_1075#his..." 
S30E06_1077#"...personal property to Ana."
S30E06_1080#This looks airtight.
S30E06_1082#And believe me, I know marriage law.
S30E06_1084#Yeah, I read him divorce decrees to get him to go to sleep.
S30E06_1087#Boom-chaka-laka!
S30E06_1089#Ana, is this true?
S30E06_1091#No. It's just another one of their stupid pranks.
S30E06_1094#My sweet Moe,
S30E06_1096#there is no way to fake what we have.
S30E06_1102#Oh, I can't do it.
S30E06_1103#I-I just, I can't risk another heartbreak.
S30E06_1105#I'm... I'm sorry.
S30E06_1109#So, uh, am I still getting paid?
S30E06_1112#Wait, you're not from Russia?
S30E06_1113#No, Brooklyn.
S30E06_1115#Back when Brooklyn was Brooklyn.
S30E06_1118#You know what I mean?
S30E06_1119#Ana, what about you?
S30E06_1122#I'm not Russian at all.
S30E06_1124#I'm from Columbus, Ohio.
S30E06_1125#That's even worse.
S30E06_1127#Ana, you're a scam artist.
S30E06_1129#And one that didn't aim too high.
S30E06_1130#What do you mean?
S30E06_1132#You know I'm in debt, right?
S30E06_1134#Serious, serious debt.
S30E06_1135#Just look at my invites.
S30E06_1138#You still wanna marry me?
S30E06_1142#Well, it looks like this just became a shotgun wedding.
S30E06_1147#It's time for youse two to leave.
S30E06_1149#Fine. I'll find another man
S30E06_1151#and give him what he dreams of.
S30E06_1152#I just have to, uh...
S30E06_1154#speak a little like this.
S30E06_1157#Or maybe Scottish, like...
S30E06_1160#Oh, do my ears deceive me?
S30E06_1162#Are you from the Highlands?
S30E06_1165#Aye. Between Inverness and the Moray Firth.
S30E06_1168#Oh, well, you'll love this guy.
S30E06_1169#He's loaded.
S30E06_1172#Let's go.
S30E06_1175#Wait. Why are you wearing a wedding dress?
S30E06_1177#Is it because you're a loon
S30E06_1179#that got stood up and can't get over it?
S30E06_1183#Just like Mother.
S30E06_1185#When are we gonna warn Willie? 
S30E06_1187#Why do we have to warn Willie?
S30E06_1188#He doesn't have any money.
S30E06_1190#Okay. Then when are we gonna warn her?
S30E06_1191#We don't need to warn her.
S30E06_1193#Her heart is as cold as a Rocky Mountain Duff.
S30E06_1196#D.J. Kirk, let's get this party rockin'.
S30E06_1200#Did somebody say crank up the volume?
S30E06_1206#- No one said crank up the volume. - Damn it.
S30E06_1219#Papa?
S30E06_1222#Son, it's... it's so great to see you.
S30E06_1226#I wanna hear everything about your top secret mission.
S30E06_1228#Of course. Of course.
S30E06_1230#Let me just go, uh, get some space cigarettes
S30E06_1233#and we'll have a long, long talk.
S30E06_1234#I'd like that.
S30E06_1237#Oh, I finally have a dad again.
S28E18_96#Come now, George.
S28E18_98#At least this Scottish groundskeeper
S28E18_100#will give your remains a respectful burial.
S28E18_104#Into the crapper you go, useless froggy garbage.
S28E18_108#Are you going to put a good spin on that, too?
S28E18_110#Are you?!
S28E18_111#Well, are you?
S28E18_113#Well, uh... ribbit?
S28E18_118#I can't put these grades on the refrigerator.
S28E18_121#I can't even put them on the garage refrigerator.
S28E18_123#It's not my fault. I blame "So-key-ity." 
S28E18_125#What?!
S28E18_126#You know, so-key-ity.
S28E18_128#That's what everyone blames for everything.
S28E18_131#You mean "Society"?
S28E18_132#Yeah, that's the guy. 
S28E18_134#Honey, I know you're a bright boy,
S28E18_137#but if you don't try harder in school,
S28E18_138#you could end up...
S28E18_148#...not a success.
S28E18_150#Oh, that. Don't worry, Mom.
S28E18_152#As long as I can stand on a corner
S28E18_154#and spin a sign reading "New condos,"
S28E18_155#I'll be just fine.
S28E18_169#All that pacing isn't gonna fix the boy.
S28E18_170#Just get him some pills.
S28E18_172#Two pinks and a blue, and it's off to the races.
S28E18_174#Everything we've tried with Bart has failed.
S28E18_176#What if there's nothing we can do?
S28E18_178#"Nothing we can do" is a whole lot better
S28E18_180#than "It'll take all we've got."
S28E18_183#I wonder if anyone talks about parenting online.
S28E18_189#Look at this one!
S28E18_190#They're skiing.
S28E18_192#Skiing means happy.
S28E18_194#An expert with a new book to promote.
S28E18_198#I wonder if she'd be willing to speak to a group for a fee.
S28E18_203#Getting your child established
S28E18_205#on the path to success isn't easy.
S28E18_208#I was driving my daughter from her falconry tournament
S28E18_211#to lute class when she turned to me asked...
S28E18_214#...which is Mandarin for, "How do you do it?"
S28E18_217#She and I are learning Mandarin.
S28E18_219#The answer?
S28E18_221#Positive reinforcement.
S28E18_225#In a recent study, this mouse was denied food
S28E18_228#whenever he failed to find his way through a maze.
S28E18_231#The mouse ended up dying... of low self-esteem.
S28E18_236#I had a nightmare where that happened to Bart,
S28E18_239#but I never told you about it.
S28E18_241#I love it when you don't tell me things.
S28E18_243#This mouse was given food
S28E18_245#whether he got through the maze or not.
S28E18_247#And this fall, he'll be in a lab at Harvard.
S28E18_254#Low self-esteem can cripple your child's chances of success.
S28E18_257#The cure: praise.
S28E18_260#Praise they can hold in their hands.
S28E18_263#Certificates, ribbons and, yes, even trophies.
S28E18_266#Trophies.
S28E18_268#So that's the easy answer.
S28E18_271#If Ralphie's shelf says he's a winner,
S28E18_272#then he'll be one!
S28E18_275#And Moe yells a third thing to feel part of the group!
S28E18_279#Yes! Trophies-- that's what Bart needs.
S28E18_282#This is how we save him.
S28E18_284#Give Bart a trophy? What for?
S28E18_287#Most boogers wiped on a bedroom wall?
S28E18_289#They're giving trophies for that now?
S28E18_291#I weep for this country.
S28E18_293#Bart's future is at stake.
S28E18_295#Besides, I'm tired of Springfield missing out
S28E18_297#on every parenting trend, 
S28E18_299#like the time-out and the diaper.
S28E18_301#I never got a trophy when I was a kid,
S28E18_303#and I turned out just...
S28E18_311#...fine.
S28E18_315#He's my son, and he's getting a trophy for nothing.
S28E18_318#You hear me? For nothing!
S28E18_324#Good morning.
S28E18_326#How's my special little winner?
S28E18_328#How'd you get that thing in my bed without waking me up?
S28E18_331#Because you're a champion sleeper.
S28E18_334#It's the craziest thing.
S28E18_336#She will not give up on that kid.
S28E18_338#Trophies can boost self-esteem.
S28E18_341#If you actually win them, like I did.
S28E18_344#But what's the point of just handing out unearned statues?
S28E18_346#And statuettes.
S28E18_348#Well, it's just a waste of gullible parents' money.
S28E18_351#Waste of gullible parents' money.
S28E18_353#Gullible parents' money.
S28E18_356#Money. Money.
S28E18_359#Step right up! Every kid's a winner!
S28E18_362#The more you spend, the more you love!
S28E18_368#I thought you agreed that trophies should be earned.
S28E18_371#I'm earning nature's trophy: money.
S28E18_373#Remember, folks.
S28E18_375#Nothing but a genuine Trophyland trophy says
S28E18_378#to your kids that...
S28E18_380#*You're the best around*
S28E18_382#*Nothing's gonna ever keep you down*
S28E18_385#*You're the best around*

S28E18_399#*You're the best around*
S28E18_401#*Nothing's gonna ever keep you down*
S28E18_403#*You're the best.*
S28E18_407#These stupid, loving parents will buy trophies
S28E18_409#for any accomplishment.
S28E18_412#Not wetting the bed, using your inside voice,
S28E18_414#even "Go watch TV in the other room."
S28E18_417#I still think these things are good for their self-esteem.
S28E18_421#Not to mention the self-esteem that comes from wad riffling.
S28E18_425#Look, I even put the boy to work.
S28E18_428#Well, then he should get a trophy for that.
S28E18_431#We have a saying in the participation trophy business.
S28E18_434#"Don't get high-- self-esteem--
S28E18_436#on your own supply-- of self-esteem."
S28E18_438#I don't care. I'm giving him this.
S28E18_441#What? Why did it break?
S28E18_442#The parts are of the highest quality.
S28E18_445#They come from the China of China: India.
S28E18_450#Boy, did you glue this trophy together with bubblegum?
S28E18_453#Eh, sticky is sticky. I'm taking my break.
S28E18_462#See? Giving him trophies did nothing.
S28E18_463#You've showered him with praise,
S28E18_465#and he's just as lazy as ever.
S28E18_467#Shh! What if he heard you say that?
S28E18_470#Hey, if Bart is as bad at eavesdropping
S28E18_472#as he is at everything else,
S28E18_474#we've got nothing to worry about.
S28E18_476#I say we keep talking loudly.
S28E18_478#But what about his confidence?
S28E18_480#Face it. Our son is a screw-up.
S28E18_483#He was born a screw-up, and no matter how hard he tries--
S28E18_485#which he never will--
S28E18_487#Bart will always be a screw-up.
S28E18_491#And have you ever heard that sound he makes when he's sad?
S28E18_493#Pathetic.
S28E18_501#Queen's bishop Lomotil takes king's Ativan.
S28E18_504#Oh, looks like I'll be having a panic attack

S28E18_512#Abe, that's your grandson.
S28E18_514#Come visit me!
S28E18_516#I'm so lonely!
S28E18_521#What's got you down, kiddo?
S28E18_523#My dad says I'm terrible at everything.
S28E18_526#Oh, he's just repeating what he heard as a boy from me.
S28E18_529#Oh, I was an awful father, just like my old man.
S28E18_532#Your dad didn't believe in you, either?
S28E18_533#It wasn't his fault.
S28E18_535#He was just focused on his career
S28E18_538#as a professional child-beater.
S28E18_540#Men would come from five towns over
S28E18_542#to study my father's technique.
S28E18_544#But no matter how many strangles he patented,

S28E18_555#That's loser talk!
S28E18_557#You're a great kid, and I'm gonna prove it to you.
S28E18_561#Boy, this here's a real trophy.
S28E18_563#Our family's most prized possession:
S28E18_566#a Baumont Chrono-master Elite.
S28E18_568#It's been a Simpson heirloom
S28E18_570#ever since it was stolen off a dead body at Gettysburg.
S28E18_573#In 1982.
S28E18_577#Wait. Is this just another gold shiny thing
S28E18_579#to trick me into feeling special when I'm not?
S28E18_581#You are special!
S28E18_582#You're like my prostate--
S28E18_585#a spiky little troublemaker who plays by his own rules.
S28E18_588#You don't take hooey from Louie.
S28E18_590#Never have, never will.
S28E18_595#I feel something.
S28E18_597#It's like a sunburn on the inside.
S28E18_598#It's called "Pride."
S28E18_600#Every tick will remind you
S28E18_602#you've got a grandpa who believes in you.

S28E18_628#You all lost-- to me!
S28E18_633#Lisa, are you suggesting we engage in excellence bias?
S28E18_637#She's loser-shaming me.
S28E18_644#Why do you always have to make trouble, ya wee harpy?
S28E18_646#How am I supposed to stay silent
S28E18_649#when parents are just blindly chasing the latest trend?
S28E18_651#Ugh, parents.
S28E18_653#Those lazy lunch-packers.
S28E18_655#They just want to be told what to do.
S28E18_658#And there's no shortage of experts who want to tell 'em.
S28E18_661#No shortage of experts.
S28E18_663#Experts. Experts. Experts.
S28E18_667#Another parenting expert, eh?
S28E18_672#Clearly, this is a community in the grip
S28E18_674#of an addiction to trophies.
S28E18_675#Now, parents,
S28E18_677#I warn you, too much praise creates millennials--
S28E18_680#a generation of soft, entitled narcissists,
S28E18_683#who drop out of college to become deejays.
S28E18_687#That only pays well at the very highest levels.
S28E18_690#Instead of showering your kids with gifts,
S28E18_693#you should prod them to greatness with GRIT.
S28E18_695#Get up. Retry.
S28E18_697#I don't care if you're...
S28E18_699#Tired.
S28E18_701#He's got a word made of other words.
S28E18_703#He must know what he's talking about.
S28E18_705#Oh, it is an end to praise.
S28E18_706#Praise Vishnu.
S28E18_710#Remember, GRIT also stands for:
S28E18_713#Get Rid of Idiotic Trophies.
S28E18_716#Another word word! He did it again!
S28E18_719#Why does the word "Of" Sometimes count in the acronym
S28E18_722#and sometimes not?
S28E18_723#Shut up, Mel!

S28E18_742#Hi, Homer. How's the trophy business?
S28E18_744#Nobody wants them anymore, thanks to GRIT.
S28E18_747#Stupid parenting method I can't exploit for money.
S28E18_750#Actually kinda makes sense.
S28E18_752#Hate it so much.
S28E18_754#I know that.
S28E18_756#That's my dad's old pocket watch.
S28E18_758#How did you get it?
S28E18_760#Oh, Grampa said I earned it.
S28E18_762#I guess someone in this family's proud of me.
S28E18_764#Oh, you didn't want it, did you?
S28E18_766#Yeah, right.
S28E18_768#That watch means nothing to me.
S28E18_770#Really? Then how do you explain that case you made?
S28E18_773#I built it to always remind me of what not to want.
S28E18_776#What about your self-published novel?
S28E18_778#Well, the character of John Homer
S28E18_780#is only partly based on me.
S28E18_782#Well, if I didn't know better, 
S28E18_784#I'd say you were obsessed with getting Grampa's watch.
S28E18_788#Ooh, thanks for the analysis, Dr. Freud.
S28E18_791#Next you'll be telling me that this whole trophy business,
S28E18_794#and in fact, all my get-rich-quick schemes over the years, 
S28E18_797#are born of a desperate need for approval
S28E18_800#from a father who couldn't show love.
S28E18_802#Likely because of his traumatic relationship
S28E18_805#with his own father, and his before him, and so on.
S28E18_809#But, unfortunately, Dr. Freud,
S28E18_813#that couldn't be further from the truth, Doctor.
S28E18_815#If you say so.
S28E18_817#Now I'm gonna take this out and see what life is like
S28E18_820#with real love and encouragement ticking in my pocket.
S28E18_824#Stupid watch.
S28E18_825#Doesn't even have a fob.
S28E18_827#Bart, where's the fob?
S28E18_829#Bart, you look like a fool!
S28E18_837#*You're the best around*
S28E18_840#*Nothing's gonna ever keep you down*
S28E18_843#*You're the best around*
S28E18_845#*Nothing's gonna ever keep you down*
S28E18_848#*You're the best around*
S28E18_851#*Nothing's gonna ever keep you down*
S28E18_855#*Down*
S28E18_858#*Fight till the end 'cause your life will depend*
S28E18_860#*On the strength that you have inside you*
S28E18_863#*Ah, got to be proud, staring...*
S28E18_867#No!
S28E18_871#*You're the worst around*
S28E18_874#*Everything's gonna bring you down.*
S28E18_878#Okay, Milhouse, I'll drop a rock, you watch it come down.
S28E18_881#That should be where Grampa's watch landed.
S28E18_885#Did you see where the rock landed?
S28E18_886#In my eye!
S28E18_889#That watch was the only thing that made me not terrible.
S28E18_891#I can't lose it.
S28E18_893#I'll drop another rock a few feet to the left.
S28E18_898#My other eye!
S28E18_905#Not a single one has missed me!
S28E18_910#What are you doing?
S28E18_913#That expert at the school said trophies are bad for kids.
S28E18_916#It's all part of GRIT.
S28E18_918#No, no.
S28E18_920#My trophies were earned.
S28E18_922#Even the soccer one?
S28E18_924#I went to most of the practices.
S28E18_927#Yeah, but what happens when another parenting expert
S28E18_930#comes along with a whole new theory on self-esteem?
S28E18_932#Another expert?
S28E18_934#Who are they? What are they saying?
S28E18_947#Okay, the watch is gone.
S28E18_949#I guess I can live with being a useless, worthless nothing
S28E18_952#as long as no one finds out.
S28E18_954#Sweetie, your grampa's on the phone.
S28E18_956#Hello.
S28E18_958#Great news, kiddo.
S28E18_960#Remember That magazine is putting out
S28E18_962#their annual family heirlooms issue.
S28E18_964#They want us for the cover.
S28E18_966#You, me and the pocket watch.
S28E18_969#It's a great story.
S28E18_971#Passing a beloved heirloom from grandfather to grandson.
S28E18_974#A gift that restored a child's faith in himself.
S28E18_977#Uh, Grampa, there's something I have to tell you.
S28E18_979#Hold on one second.
S28E18_980#I'm just finishing up
S28E18_982#a mandatory pre-article heart exam.
S28E18_986#Doc says as long as I don't suffer any major disappointments, 
S28E18_988#I'll be fine.
S28E18_990#Now, what did you want to tell me?
S28E18_992#Uh, helmets ruined football.
S28E18_994#Exactly! If you want to protect your head,
S28E18_996#grow your hair long.
S28E18_998#Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
S28E18_1001#And you won't be late because you've got that watch.
S28E18_1005#Stupid parenting experts.
S28E18_1007#Why don't they write a book called Stop Buying These Books?
S28E18_1010#Everybody'd buy that.
S28E18_1012#Even if I was listening to what you said,
S28E18_1014#it doesn't matter, nothing matters.
S28E18_1016#My trophy business has failed
S28E18_1018#and Bart has the thing I wanted most:
S28E18_1020#Grampa's watch.
S28E18_1021#What watch?
S28E18_1023#The one you get for being a success.
S28E18_1025#Well, then I should have it.
S28E18_1027#Uh, that never really came up.
S28E18_1029#All that's left to do now is bring these to the needy.
S28E18_1034#Best I can do is charge you ten dollars
S28E18_1036#to throw them in my Dumpster.
S28E18_1038#How about I give you a trophy that says "Best Pawn Shop"?
S28E18_1041#Not unless I earned it.
S28E18_1044#Dad's watch!
S28E18_1046#Hey, dirtbag shopkeep.
S28E18_1047#How did this come to you?
S28E18_1049#Some kid brought it in.
S28E18_1050#Said he was mad at his friend
S28E18_1052#for dropping so many rocks in his eye.
S28E18_1056#That dude's seen a lot of living.
S28E18_1060#Yours for 20 bucks.
S28E18_1061#That's an insult.
S28E18_1063#You're talking about a self-worth-boosting antique
S28E18_1066#that's been in my family for generations.
S28E18_1068#Twenty-two?
S28E18_1070#You'll take it all and you'll like it.
S28E18_1078#Yes. I have it.
S28E18_1080#Some said it would never happen.
S28E18_1082#Most were unaware of the situation.
S28E18_1084#But I finally have my father's watch!
S28E18_1092#Bart, look what Daddy's got now.
S28E18_1099#Grampa was the only person who believed in me.
S28E18_1102#But when he finds out I lost the watch,
S28E18_1104#even he'll give up.
S28E18_1106#Stay strong, Homer.
S28E18_1108#Don't go soft on him now.
S28E18_1110#This is a once-in-a-lifetime face-rubbing-in.
S28E18_1113#Come on, foot. Kick, damn you!
S28E18_1120#Son, I found something that belongs to you.
S28E18_1123#Grampa's watch!
S28E18_1124#No. I can't take it.
S28E18_1126#I didn't earn it, so I don't deserve it.
S28E18_1128#You were right.
S28E18_1129#I am a screwup.
S28E18_1131#But, boy, who screwed you up?
S28E18_1135#You.
S28E18_1137#It was you.
S28E18_1139#And those who came before.
S28E18_1149#It's stuck in your hand fat.
S28E18_1151#You got to wedge something in there to break the vacuum.
S28E18_1159#Okay.
S28E18_1161#Smile, my little watch watcher.
S28E18_1172#That was a nice thing you did.
S28E18_1174#Which parenting guide told you to do it?
S28E18_1177#Well, baby, sometimes you just got to trust your gut.
S30E07_98#not spaghetti, not meatloaf,
S30E07_100#missing chili, absence of mac and cheese!
S30E07_102#There must be some food here.
S30E07_106#The devil's trees.
S30E07_108#No!
S30E07_110#- Homie, relax. - Okay.
S30E07_112#I've decided to be a Tubberware salesperson.
S30E07_115#Tubberware? Isn't that the thing
S30E07_116#where you find people to host parties
S30E07_118#where you then sell everyone plastic food boxes?
S30E07_121#Well, you do your Kickstarters.
S30E07_123#Hey, if people pay to send me on my tour
S30E07_126#of rocking chairs in the Midwest, that helps everyone.
S30E07_129#We really could use the money.
S30E07_131#They're still garnishing your wages
S30E07_133#after that garnish war you waged.
S30E07_135#Please, Homie.
S30E07_137#I want to open a checking account
S30E07_139#so the family finally has one.
S30E07_142#Marge, no wife of mine will ever have to work.
S30E07_145#Is what men used to say for some insane reason.
S30E07_147#You have my blessing.
S30E07_149#Where's Jasper? He's late again.
S30E07_151#Maybe we should feed the birds without him.
S30E07_154#Don't tell me you fed the birds without me?
S30E07_156#You were in a coma!
S30E07_157#Mein Gott, what else happened?
S30E07_159#You won't like who's president.
S30E07_160#It's not Bernie?
S30E07_167#Lisa returned Jasper's childhood,
S30E07_169#and all she wanted was her own secret giggle.
S30E07_173#Jasper.
S30E07_177#Oh, my God.
S30E07_182#What do you got there? A bento box?
S30E07_184#Somebody's ashes? Apple TV?
S30E07_186#Oy. One more guess, and I'm gonna need a nap.
S30E07_188#When I was six years old,
S30E07_190#I brought my treasure box for show-and-tell.
S30E07_193#Another kid took it, never gave it back.
S30E07_195#And now, somehow, it's here.
S30E07_197#I've been angry my whole life, but suddenly,
S30E07_199#the world seems... magical.
S30E07_203#For the first time ever,
S30E07_204#Lisa experienced a feeling
S30E07_206#that could only be described as... magnifique.
S30E07_209#I don't mean to overstate this,
S30E07_211#but the sun is shining a little bit brighter,
S30E07_214#because of me!
S30E07_217#Tubberware? I'd love to buy some.
S30E07_219#No, you don't buy it now.
S30E07_222#You have a party, and then I sell it to your friends.
S30E07_224#No!
S30E07_226#You have the party at your house...
S30E07_229#Then, when your friends fill out the order forms, we...
S30E07_233#If you host a Tubberware party,
S30E07_236#you get an exclusive gift: a lemonade pitcher!
S30E07_240#Ma'am, if the good Lord wanted us to store juice in plastic,
S30E07_244#he wouldn't have made a possum's bladder watertight.
S30E07_248#Okay, Marge, you're like
S30E07_250#a black hole of sadness and split ends.
S30E07_252#What is wrong with you?
S30E07_254#I haven't booked a single Tubberware party.
S30E07_257#I don't know why I thought I could do this.
S30E07_259#I don't have that... What's the Jewish word for "Chutzpah"?
S30E07_262#You mean you have no confidence?
S30E07_264#I don't. I always take the bad pancake.
S30E07_268#I spend so much time putting sunscreen on everyone else,
S30E07_270#I get sunburned.
S30E07_273#Ooh. Just like with a doormat, the key is underneath.
S30E07_276#You know what?
S30E07_278#I'll throw a Tubberway party for you
S30E07_280#But it's gonna take me a while to plan.
S30E07_281#How about tonight?
S30E07_282#You're on!
S30E07_285#What the heck are you doing?
S30E07_287#That's a punchbowl, and that's for leftover lasagna.
S30E07_290#What?! Whoever heard of leftover lasagna?
S30E07_294#Maybe you should just go to Moe's.
S30E07_296#Fine, but I'm not gonna get drunk.
S30E07_298#Oh, okay, sweetie, I'll get drunk.
S30E07_301#I just can't stay sober at you.
S30E07_305#I can't do this. I can't do this!
S30E07_308#Can't? Can't? Marge, I never want
S30E07_311#to hear you use the C-A-next-Tuesday word again.
S30E07_315#You need to tap into your female warrior side.
S30E07_317#I don't have one of those.
S30E07_319#Then we're gonna have to create one!
S30E07_321#Makeover time!
S30E07_325#Okay, think pretty thoughts!
S30E07_333#Now, get rid of those things on your feet and put these on.
S30E07_338#It changes my whole body.
S30E07_342#And what is going on back there?
S30E07_346#Behold, your rump has become... A booty, baby!
S30E07_351#Now go out there and sell some thingies!
S30E07_356#Julio,
S30E07_357#what is this? I don't want to sit
S30E07_359#through some kind of sales pitch.
S30E07_361#I just want a simple evening of appetizers,
S30E07_364#cocktails and nitrous oxide.
S30E07_366#Hello, boys.
S30E07_368#I see you're checking out the merchandise.
S30E07_372#Let me assure you, the lids match the tubs.
S30E07_380#Oh. You should have told us this was a drag Tubberware party.
S30E07_383#He's the most convincing woman I've ever seen.
S30E07_386#Yes, yes.
S30E07_387#He is quite the impersonator.
S30E07_390#He calls himself "Marge."
S30E07_392#Perfect! "Marge."
S30E07_395#If she were any more camp, she'd be a Coleman lantern.
S30E07_399#All right, boys, let's put tops on bottoms.
S30E07_405#And you wanted to go dancing.
S30E07_410#And voil¨¤-- a Marge-tini!
S30E07_412#But don't worry.
S30E07_414#That's not the only surprise I've got tucked away.
S30E07_417#-She's funny. -Bea Arthur funny?
S30E07_418#No one's that funny.
S30E07_422#And that night, Marge sold more Tubberware than she ever imagined.
S30E07_425#And I, drawn by the farcical premise,
S30E07_428#began narrating her story, too.
S30E07_430#Look at all these orders!
S30E07_432#I'm really good at this.
S30E07_434#Yeah, well, uh, you see, um...
S30E07_436#"Marge" is good at this.
S30E07_438#Yeah, Marge. Me. I'm Marge.
S30E07_441#Okay, so here's what happened, okay?
S30E07_444#This is so important, I'm gonna drop the accent.
S30E07_447#Everyone thought you were a drag queen.
S30E07_452#I felt so pretty, but the whole time,
S30E07_454#people thought I was a man.
S30E07_456#A man who looked like a fabulous woman!
S30E07_460#Drag queens can be very beautiful. Exhibit: me.
S30E07_463#I call myself "Penelope Cruising."
S30E07_467#I was Mr. Burns's date for the Kennedy Center Honors.
S30E07_469#See? Look how cute I am.
S30E07_472#All his dates have to give him transfusions.
S30E07_475#Now I know why he said I was his type.
S30E07_478#You get it?
S30E07_480#Well, the next time, I'm just going to be myself.
S30E07_482#But that was you, you with confidence.
S30E07_485#Oh, you're just being nice.
S30E07_487#It was ju! It was ju! It was ju!
S30E07_490#And besides, the top Tubberware sellers--
S30E07_492#they're all drag queens.
S30E07_494#What? That can't be true.
S30E07_501#So, what do you say, Marge? Are you in it to win it?
S30E07_503#Go for it, Marge!
S30E07_505#Who cares if what's outside doesn't match what's inside?
S30E07_508#I'm labeled "Lunch Snacks,"
S30E07_510#But people use me to store pot.
S30E07_512#And I'm for storing bread.
S30E07_514#All the bread you're gonna make selling Tubberware.
S30E07_518#Did you just high-five that bowl?
S30E07_521#Be cool, Marge. Be cool.
S30E07_524#Homer, order anything you like. It's on me.
S30E07_527#Anything.
S30E07_529#Okay. I'm gonna need two menus and four tables.
S30E07_531#And get rid of all this silverware.
S30E07_533#- It just slows me down. - I got it. I got it.
S30E07_536#We need help. Someone get Mama back from bingo.
S30E07_539#I am on my way.
S30E07_541#But all you need is a "G."
S30E07_544#You should be like the "G" in gnocchi-- silent!
S30E07_549#Oh, Marge, thank you.
S30E07_551#Thank you. I'm so happy!
S30E07_554#And there it is.
S30E07_558#Leftover lasagna.
S30E07_570#Lisa still felt sort of magnifique,
S30E07_573#but the magical feeling from her good deed started to fade.
S30E07_575#So she thought:
S30E07_577#why not secretly bring magic into others' lives?
S30E07_579#Yes.
S30E07_581#Her first project: restore the lost love
S30E07_584#between the identical-looking Kirk and Luann.
S30E07_603#Looks like dying my nose hair's really paying off!
S30E07_606#Next, Lisa helped Gil,
S30E07_608#Springfield's Pep¨¦ Le Pew, minus the charm.
S30E07_611#Sir, would ya like one? No, huh? Well, I guess not.
S30E07_614#Ma'am? Uh, maybe next time.
S30E07_617#Come on! I only get paid if they're all gone.
S30E07_619#And they check the trash, believe me.
S30E07_622#Oh, my God. People are taking them!
S30E07_626#I'm turning the heat on in my car tonight.
S30E07_633#Bart. Wake up.
S30E07_635#Bart! I need your help again.
S30E07_636#But Lisa's greatest challenge
S30E07_638#was to make Mrs. Skinner believe in her son again.
S30E07_641#So Lisa created an imaginary journal for Seymour,
S30E07_643#one that would mend all fences.
S30E07_646#I have to get this fake diary into Skinner's house.
S30E07_649#Here's the key.
S30E07_650#Here's a floor plan of the house.
S30E07_652#Oh, and here's some tuna. I'm making his cat really fat.
S30E07_658#So Lisa hid the diary
S30E07_660#where she knew Mrs. Skinner would find it--
S30E07_663#anywhere a grown man would expect privacy.
S30E07_667#"Mother is a great woman."
S30E07_669#Seymour loves me!
S30E07_671#Oh, my God! How does a mother apologize
S30E07_675#for 50 years of ridiculing her son?
S30E07_678#A gift card now, and an apology on my deathbed.
S30E07_681#Meanwhile, to help perfect her art and increase business,
S30E07_685#Julio took Marge to Springfield's hottest drag club,
S30E07_688#with its most confusing bathroom signage.
S30E07_692#Marge, this is Queen Chant¨¦,
S30E07_694#Barbra Streisman,
S30E07_696#the Mysterious Waylon,
S30E07_698#and Fiona Adams Apple.
S30E07_700#Hello, squirrel-friend.
S30E07_702#You're the tallest thing I ever...
S30E07_704#And you're still getting up.
S30E07_705#Honey, I spend half my day getting up
S30E07_707#and the other half getting down.
S30E07_710#- Oh-kurr?! - This is the kind of confidence that you need.
S30E07_713#The secret is to imagine
S30E07_715#the fiercest version of yourself, then realize...
S30E07_718#you are that version!
S30E07_720#Mel, is that you?
S30E07_723#Yes! I've taped my bone between my legs.
S30E07_726#Your Majesty, can Marge lip-synch with us?
S30E07_729#Honey, I'll tell you what I told Eddie Murphy:
S30E07_731#"Sure, why not?"
S30E07_734#So, tell me about this "Marge" character.
S30E07_736#What is she like?
S30E07_738#Well, she's long-suffering,
S30E07_740#kind of a single mom...
S30E07_742#and that's it.
S30E07_744#She's a damn hero, is what she is, sis.
S30E07_752#*You've got all eyes on you*
S30E07_754#*A nasty housewife lady*
S30E07_756#*Come out of your mom shell*
S30E07_758#*And become a bombshell*
S30E07_761#*You've got this, Margie*
S30E07_763#*You're stronger than you know*
S30E07_764#*Get up and dance*
S30E07_766#*Get up, get up and*
S30E07_768#*Sashay with Chant¨¦*
S30E07_770#*Work that blue bouffant¨¦*
S30E07_772#*Do it, do it*
S30E07_774#*All the boys say*
S30E07_776#Women can have it all.
S30E07_778#Even penises!
S30E07_779#*She's so chic*
S30E07_781#*Such savoir faire*
S30E07_783#*Serving housewife realness*
S30E07_785#*Selling Tubberware*
S30E07_787#*She's a female phenomenon*
S30E07_789#*And much more than a mom*
S30E07_791#*So sexy, so snuggable*
S30E07_793#*Her cocoa is so chuggable*
S30E07_795#*Our blue duck has become a swan*
S30E07_798#*She's a Glamazon.*
S30E07_801#*Sashay with Chant¨¦*
S30E07_803#*Work that blue bouffant¨¦...*
S30E07_804#Oh, hi, Helen.
S30E07_806#Hi, Marge.
S30E07_808#I heard you're selling Tubberware.
S30E07_810#Money troubles at home?
S30E07_812#Why are you so bitter, Helen?
S30E07_815#Is it because your husband would rather play with his toy train
S30E07_817#than with you?
S30E07_819#All aboard!
S30E07_820#Not Helen!
S30E07_823#You better beware, Bart.
S30E07_825#Mom just grew a backbone.
S30E07_832#You mean it, Mother?
S30E07_834#You'll finally let me take karate lessons?
S30E07_836#I'll even buy you a gi.
S30E07_838#Oh, I won't have to wear pajamas?
S30E07_839#Only at bedtime--
S30E07_842#which I'm moving to after The Big Bang Theory.
S30E07_844#Bazinga!
S30E07_845#All seemed well,
S30E07_847#but like Young Sheldon, it would not last forever.
S30E07_854#Oh, hello, Mother. Karate is so much better than I ever...
S30E07_857#Seymour! I knew this journal was a lie!
S30E07_859#Um, how would you know that?
S30E07_862#Seymour never uses semicolons.
S30E07_865#He says they make him queasy.
S30E07_867#I don't even keep a journal. I have no inner thoughts.
S30E07_870#I planted that journal. I'm sorry.
S30E07_872#I did it so you'd be nicer to your son.
S30E07_875#Nicer?! I spoiled the little loser!
S30E07_878#But not anymore.
S30E07_880#I'm so sorry.
S30E07_885#Oh, my God, that poor girl.
S30E07_888#Go to her, Seymour. Give her an "A."
S30E07_891#The teachers' union forbids me from giving out
S30E07_893#anything more encouraging than a pumpkin sticker.
S30E07_895#You're a disgrace to that yellow belt!
S30E07_898#Look at me, boys!
S30E07_901#I'm living off my wife like Mr. Meryl Streep!
S30E07_903#Don Gummer.
S30E07_905#Homer, do you know exactly what Marge is up to?
S30E07_908#Because, uh, we know, and we've told everybody except you.
S30E07_910#Like true friends.
S30E07_912#What's going on?
S30E07_914#If you want to know the truth,
S30E07_916#- go to this address. - That's the address of this bar.
S30E07_919#That's right. Get really drunk,
S30E07_921#then go to this address.
S30E07_929#Hello. Are you on the list?
S30E07_931#I have to be on the list for a Tubberware party?
S30E07_933#Well, you do for this one.
S30E07_936#Marge is like if Donna Reed and Donna Summer combined
S30E07_939#to solve all your food storage problems.
S30E07_942#And rumor has it, out of drag,
S30E07_944#Marge is hot, hunky and all man.
S30E07_947#My wife is none of those things!
S30E07_949#She leaves the room to burp!
S30E07_952#Marge! You didn't tell me you're tricking all these people
S30E07_955#into thinking you're a drag queen, when you're really
S30E07_958#a regular housewife in need of empowerment, and now...
S30E07_961#that I say it out loud, it doesn't seem so bad.
S30E07_964#She's not a female impersonator.
S30E07_965#She's just a personator.
S30E07_967#Women co-opt everything.
S30E07_969#Good to see another couple in trouble.
S30E07_971#Let's go, Dewey.
S30E07_973#I'm not leaving till I find my butter tub.
S30E07_975#Look in the mirror.
S30E07_982#Kids, please give us a moment.
S30E07_983#You're cool.
S30E07_986#Marjorie, I'm not a perfect man,
S30E07_988#But I like to think I've evolved.
S30E07_990#I've accepted the several different actors
S30E07_991#Who played Batman.
S30E07_993#I now believe cats should earn as much as dogs."
S30E07_996#I don't want to hear your stupid speech.
S30E07_999#I had a moment of confidence, and now it's destroyed.
S30E07_1003#I'm going out. You can watch the kids
S30E07_1004#and wonder where I am.
S30E07_1013#No. I don't want anything to do with him.
S30E07_1022#Lisa, are you okay?
S30E07_1024#I tried to play God, and like the real God,
S30E07_1026#it went horribly wrong.
S30E07_1028#Life was a struggle for the Simpson women.
S30E07_1030#Even Maggie.
S30E07_1033#But where there is life, there is hope.
S30E07_1039#That was the beginning of a new day, a wonderful day,
S30E07_1042#a day that would soon change the Simpson women forever.
S30E07_1061#Read the tots.
S30E07_1063#"Go to the roof"?
S30E07_1064#Enjoy.
S30E07_1065#Next!
S30E07_1069#Aw, man!
S30E07_1074#Lisa, would you join us for lunch?
S30E07_1077#We decided to bring some magic into your life.
S30E07_1083#Ah, you deserve it, sweetie. You're the only person
S30E07_1086#in this town who thinks about someone other than herself.
S30E07_1089#The only person who would listen to old Gil when he...
S30E07_1092#She had finally found her place to eat lunch.
S30E07_1095#But what is this? Has Homer lost his will to drink?
S30E07_1098#Homer, we're sorry we razzed ya.
S30E07_1100#We were just trying to hurt your feelings.
S30E07_1102#I am so sorry.
S30E07_1104#I don't know what I can do.
S30E07_1106#Nothing you can do. Change your name,
S30E07_1108#glue on a wig and find yourself a new woman.
S30E07_1110#That's it!
S30E07_1111#Moe, you're a genius!
S30E07_1112#Wish me luck.
S30E07_1117#Why do people always stride out without paying their tab?
S30E07_1121#I have no idea. But as God is my witness,
S30E07_1124#I will find out!
S30E07_1128#You two stay right there.
S30E07_1133#Everyone, I have two enormously sad things
S30E07_1136#I feel a need to tell all of you.
S30E07_1138#Number one-- I've deceived you.
S30E07_1140#I'm not a drag queen.
S30E07_1143#Girl, you didn't deceive nobody.
S30E07_1144#We all knew.
S30E07_1146#I didn't know, but I'm super self-involved.
S30E07_1148#Oh. Now number two.
S30E07_1151#And, as always happens in such matters,
S30E07_1153#number two is the kicker.
S30E07_1156#My husband and I have had more than the usual number of scrapes,
S30E07_1159#but we've always gotten back to our love.
S30E07_1160#But this time,
S30E07_1163#you all made me feel understood and supported,
S30E07_1167#and therefore made me realize how selfish Homer is.
S30E07_1171#Honey.
S30E07_1173#And what hurts the most is that I can't imagine
S30E07_1176#there's anything he can say or do to make me come back.
S30E07_1180#Oh. Well, then I went through a lot of work for nothing.
S30E07_1184#- Homie. - Honey, I understand it now.
S30E07_1187#The feeling of power, the mystery,
S30E07_1189#is she or isn't she?
S30E07_1192#Hey, believe me, nobody is wondering, baby.
S30E07_1200#If you don't go to him, Marge, I will.
S30E07_1202#And he will never leave my kitchen.
S30E07_1204#My pulled pork banh mi keeps baby in the cradle.
S30E07_1208#Oh, Homie, I love you!
S30E07_1217#Having a man dressed like a woman
S30E07_1219#to win back his woman who pretended to be
S30E07_1221#a man dressed like a woman
S30E07_1223#is the most romantic thing I've ever seen.
S30E07_1226#And so all was well.
S30E07_1231#or, in English...
S30E07_1233#Bye!
S30E07_1239#So, are you a... you're a drag queen now?
S30E07_1241#I don't know. I guess these days it's okay for everyone
S30E07_1243#to be everything.
S30E07_1245#So, miss, are you alone?
S30E07_1247#It's me, Homer!
S30E07_1252#All the good ones are either married or Homer.
S28E19_96#Except this time.
S28E19_98#Fun facts: the odds of a baseball hitting a bird
S28E19_102#are one in a billion, but I've seen it four times.
S28E19_104#We're out of beer!
S28E19_108#Burnsie, old buddy, you care for a cigar?
S28E19_109#Oh, thanks, but no.
S28E19_111#If I inhale warmed air, I tend to float away.
S28E19_115#You ever think we're watching the last generation of nukemen?
S28E19_118#No one wants to go into this dirty business anymore.
S28E19_121#Fiddle-faddle, nuclear power is the industry of tomorrow.
S28E19_123#Oh, yeah? Says who?
S28E19_124#Life magazine,
S28E19_126#The Saturday Evening Stenograph,
S28E19_127#and Professor Noodle Stroodle 
S28E19_129#and the Dove Soap March of Comedy.
S28E19_131#Me? I'm thinking of getting into, uh, to solar.
S28E19_134#I won't use it myself,
S28E19_136#I'll sell it to the poor people and the musicians.
S28E19_138#Oh, not me.
S28E19_140#I vow that nuclear power will continue
S28E19_142#long after my body is gone
S28E19_144#and my brain is in a shark that can walk on land.
S28E19_146#I'll educate a new generation of nuclear workers.
S28E19_149#And I'll find those bright-eyed radio-activists
S28E19_152#at my alma mater: Yale.
S28E19_160#I'm eatin' Mister Softee over here! -

S28E19_206#*We can't be stopped.*
S28E19_209#Well, I am here to offer you money.
S28E19_211#I'd like to endow a Department of Nuclear Plant Management.
S28E19_213#Wonderful.
S28E19_215#Of course we can't do nuclear.
S28E19_217#Our students are highly-entitled wusses.
S28E19_220#You'd be creating a space for violence to happen.
S28E19_225#How about funding a chair in the non-narrative cinema
S28E19_228#of self-identified pan-sexuals?
S28E19_231#What? What? What? What? What?!
S28E19_232#We also need to hire more deans
S28E19_234#to decide which Halloween costumes are appropriate.
S28E19_237#Eight deans should do it.
S28E19_240#Is this still a coven of capitalism
S28E19_242#where evil money can acquire a patina of virtue?
S28E19_244#Yes, that's in our charter.
S28E19_247#But with an issue as hetero-patriarchal as nuclear power,
S28E19_250#we'll have to hire multicultural empathizers,
S28E19_253#build a new safe space.
S28E19_254#Not so fast.
S28E19_257#We insist on a chair of anti-nuclear studies

S28E19_262#Absolutely, Teddy.
S28E19_264#We run all decisions past the squash team.

S28E19_297#You're worse than Hitler!

S28E19_325#Ugh. Has everything in this school surrendered to diversity?
S28E19_329#Yale's on its way out.
S28E19_331#That's why I started my own line of colleges.
S28E19_333#287 campuses.
S28E19_336#We took over all the old Circuit Citys.
S28E19_337#Really?
S28E19_340#Using teachers these holier than thou Ivies fired for cause.
S28E19_343#I celebrated Columbus Day.
S28E19_345#I, uh, referred to God as "He."

S28E19_350#Hmm, I could start my own college.
S28E19_353#We can't talk business in here.

S28E19_382#We're changing all our locks to Schlage.
S28E19_386#Eh, to be honest, I'm thinking of starting my own college.
S28E19_389#You can make a big fat profit.
S28E19_391#A for-profit college?
S28E19_392#Eh, that's where I went.
S28E19_394#University of Phoenix, Oklahoma in Washington State.
S28E19_396#At least that's where it was last month.
S28E19_397#It moves around quite a bit.
S28E19_399#A for-profit college?
S28E19_400#You said that already, sir.
S28E19_402#A for-profit college?
S28E19_405#Excellent.
S28E19_407#Kudos.

S28E19_497#what do you think of?
S28E19_499#Low-paid workforce with no healthcare in a toxic environment.
S28E19_502#And there you have them.

S28E19_509#What are you teaching, Dad?
S28E19_511#I'm giving lectures on what I do at work.
S28E19_513#Well, what do you do at work?
S28E19_515#Well, I... you know, the button stuff.
S28E19_518#Have you prepared a reading list?
S28E19_519#I have to read?
S28E19_521#No, it's for them. 
S28E19_524#But what are you actually gonna say to them?
S28E19_527#I'll start with the life cycle of the atom.
S28E19_529#A baby atom is called a "Neutron,"
S28E19_532#when it turns professional, it becomes a proton.
S28E19_535#And if it runs for office, it's an electron.

S28E19_541#How'd you guess?
S28E19_543#No, "Sheriously." 
S28E19_546#Wow, my first slurred word.
S28E19_549#Dad, a college education is important.

S28E19_554#pardon me, Mom-- dump.

S28E19_559#Oh, keep your pants on, lady. Dad! -
S28E19_561#Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!
S28E19_564#I believe in higher education.
S28E19_566#You are a teacher.
S28E19_567#If you make a joke out of it,
S28E19_570#you are crushing my only hope.
S28E19_573#As the good kid here, 
S28E19_575#I have to point out she's acting very badly.
S28E19_577#For shame.
S28E19_580#Lisa, sweetie, my professor money's going into your college fund.
S28E19_583#Ooh, that's good, I guess.
S28E19_584#How much is in it now?
S28E19_586#Depends on what we do with Grampa after he dies.
S28E19_588#Just burn me!

S28E19_616#You're a professor, so you don't throw it.
S28E19_617#In fact, you hardly ever wear it.
S28E19_619#Geez, I had this custom-made.
S28E19_621#Apartheid's over, Lenny.
S28E19_622#It worked!
S28E19_627#Man, copying is so hard.
S28E19_628#Any questions?
S28E19_630#Yes. What does it mean?
S28E19_632#Uh, what do you think it means?
S28E19_634#Remember, there are no wrong answers.
S28E19_636#Well, I would guess that, uh,
S28E19_638#three neutrons coming out when only one went in,
S28E19_641#uh, leads to some kind of chain reaction.
S28E19_643#Wrong. There's always a class clown.

S28E19_675#Guys. You know what?
S28E19_677#It's a beautiful day.
S28E19_679#Why don't we have class outside?
S28E19_681#Yes, that's it. Go on outside.
S28E19_684#I'm totally unqualified. 
S28E19_686#I don't even know how to get outside from here.
S28E19_690#That's the answer!
S28E19_691#Oh, wait.
S28E19_693#Hey, what's the matter, Professor?
S28E19_695#He don't know what to teach his class.

S28E19_854#How much are we charging for hugs, Smithers?
S28E19_857#Five dollars. But, uh, I'll give you one for free.
S28E19_858#Quiet.
S28E19_860#Monty, I want to buy the whole school.
S28E19_862#But it must include Homer Simpson.
S28E19_863#He is a great teacher.
S28E19_866#But first I must find out how much he's worth to the plant.
S28E19_871#I see. It seems I owe you a hundred thousand dollars.
S28E19_873#Great lecture, Professor S.
S28E19_875#I finally understand how gamma rays
S28E19_877#turned Bruce Banner into the Hulk.
S28E19_880#Always remember the equation, "Gamma equals green."

S28E19_886#Uh, Simpson, I've sold your contract.
S28E19_888#No! You cannot stop me from teaching.
S28E19_890#I was going to paint houses in the summer.

S28E19_923#Nope.
S28E19_926#Love was the test.
S28E19_928#And you all passed.
S28E19_940#Uh, folks, we'll be landing

S28E19_998#Are you tired from your trip?
S28E19_1000#Let's get you a refreshing cryofreeze.
S28E19_1002#Rejuvenating, huh?

S28E19_1008#Are you just asking? Or did you already pee in it?
S28E19_1011#I'm asking for a friend.
S28E19_1012#So what's our next activity?

S30E08_408#Well, I can introduce cartoons,

S30E08_437#Wait. Circus clowns hate Krusty?
S30E08_439#Don't you?
S30E08_441#In my way I've hated him all my life.
S30E08_444#Yeah, you get it, Soggy. You're a good kid.
S30E08_446#Anyway, this is where you eat, this is where you sleep,

S30E08_549#I can clown the pants off these losers.
S30E08_560#Whoa, what is that?
S30E08_562#That's what the clowns here drink before the tent opens.
S30E08_563#It's called Hippo Juice. 
S30E08_565#Do you even know what's in it?
S30E08_566#I need my Hippo Juice!

S30E08_638#Ooh, a butt-squeeze.
S30E08_640#Motivated by character and moves the story forward.
S30E08_643#Mmm. Could an ear nibble be the thing
S30E08_645#to reinvigorate this tired franchise?
S30E08_647#Wait. Are-are you recapping our snuggle?
S30E08_650#No, no, just pillow talk, baby.
S30E08_652#If you say so.
S30E08_653#Savvy viewers will notice

S30E08_660#You're watching so many TV shows for your recapping job,

S30E08_671#It's either me or the job.
S30E08_674#Hmm. Marge creates what feels like false jeopardy.
S30E08_677#No, the moment is well earned.
S30E08_682#Oh, they just got rid of their best character.
S30E08_687#Soggy, a word of advice: you suck.
S30E08_689#Turn in your Hippo Juice bucket,
S30E08_691#your hippo crystals, and your hippo pipe.
S30E08_692#You're fired.
S30E08_696#Oh, come on, Tootso.
S30E08_697#You don't really mean that, do you?
S30E08_699#Oh, it's true.
S30E08_701#I'm a terrible clown.
S30E08_704#Cheer up, Krusty.
S30E08_706#There's got to be another circus out there, a worse one.
S30E08_709#Nah. I'm not a TV clown.
S30E08_710#I'm not a circus clown.
S30E08_711#I'm nothing.

S30E08_717#after eating the Guess-Your-Weight Guy,
S30E08_719#so we need somebody to do his act.
S30E08_721#And none of the other clowns will do it
S30E08_722#because there's no net.
S30E08_724#So, well, we thought of you.
S30E08_726#You mean a last chance to redeem myself?
S30E08_728#No. No, no. If you live, you're still fired.
S30E08_730#Oh, who cares?
S30E08_731#I'm in.
S30E08_733#*I don't care*
S30E08_735#*If I live or die*
S30E08_737#*Wait, I do, I want to die*
S30E08_739#*Who will claim my body?*
S30E08_741#*Maybe the monkey*
S30E08_766#They're applauding.
S30E08_768#And there's no applause sign.
S30E08_769#I didn't know that was possible.
S30E08_772#Circus cheers are the greatest cheers in the world!
S30E08_775#There he is, there's our new star.
S30E08_778#That was the most daring act I've ever seen.
S30E08_780#And I saw a circus do a Beatles tribute without permission.
S30E08_783#I think I'm falling for you, Soggy.
S30E08_786#I don't think you're really my type.
S30E08_790#Mmm, you.
S30E08_797#My whole life up till now was nothing.
S30E08_800#From this day forward, I am Soggy,
S30E08_803#Soggy the Clown!
S30E08_828#I'm flattered, Tootso,
S30E08_830#but I'm already seeing someone.
S30E08_832#I'll meet you behind the seal tank in half an hour.
S30E08_837#Good news. Your agent just called.
S30E08_839#A Japanese game show needs an American celebrity
S30E08_841#to pop out of toilets to scare couples on dates.
S30E08_844#The cops will never find you.
S30E08_846#Two weeks ago, I would've jumped at that.
S30E08_848#But I'm a circus clown now.
S30E08_850#But you're a big-time TV star.
S30E08_852#Ain't the circus worse by far?
S30E08_854#Oh, I used to love celebrity,
S30E08_857#but I've got big top clarity.
S30E08_860#Because...
S30E08_866#*Circus clowning - Is the life for me*
S30E08_869#*Gonna flip the bird to lousy kids' TV*
S30E08_872#*Circus folk have real camaraderie*
S30E08_875#*I can't be fired 'cause they don't test my pee*
S30E08_879#*He'd be positive for every sedative*
S30E08_882#*Circus laughter, there's no greater high*
S30E08_885#*Crowd is fired up 'cause they might see you die*
S30E08_887#*If he breaks his neck*
S30E08_889#*What a thrill they'll get*
S30E08_891#*All my problems have been solved for free*
S30E08_895#*Talking to the bear sure beats therapy*
S30E08_898#*A hug can beat fear of women's feet*
S30E08_901#*Can I join the circus if I'm only ten?*
S30E08_904#*Here's a fake I.D., now your name is Ben*
S30E08_907#*Ain't no mom to keep me safe and sound*
S30E08_910#*I get to juggle swords*
S30E08_912#*Eat corn dogs off the ground*
S30E08_914#*So, good riddance to TV*
S30E08_917#*I feel alive instead of live-plus-three*
S30E08_920#*Because circus clowning is the life*
S30E08_923#*for Me.*
S30E08_928#Bad news. We're shutting down the circus.
S30E08_931#Shutting it down? But why?
S30E08_933#-A terrible video got out. -Which one?
S30E08_935#The video we sell here at the circus.
S30E08_938#If they close this place down, what do I run away to?
S30E08_940#College?
S30E08_941#It's all over.
S30E08_943#I'm losing the only happiness I didn't have to chug,
S30E08_946#snort, shoot, bet on, or get enlarged.
S30E08_948#For the first time, I was a real clown.
S30E08_951#And now I've lost that.
S30E08_956#To save my marriage, effective immediately,
S30E08_957#I'm resigning as recapper.
S30E08_959#My apologies to Culture Smash
S30E08_961#and the entire Garbage Blast media family.
S30E08_969#Get in.
S30E08_970#Okay.
S30E08_977#Homer, I'm the CEO of a major media conglomerate.
S30E08_979#We can't have you quit.
S30E08_981#You're one of America's top recappers.
S30E08_984#I had to quit; recapping was ruining my marriage.
S30E08_987#There were so many shows, I couldn't keep up.
S30E08_990#It's true. Currently there are over 500 scripted shows
S30E08_993#on network, cable, and streaming.
S30E08_995#Why are you making so many shows?
S30E08_997#No one could watch more than 300 of them.
S30E08_1000#Oh, we don't care if people watch.
S30E08_1001#We just care if they subscribe
S30E08_1003#for $13 a month.
S30E08_1007#You see, if people subscribe but don't watch,
S30E08_1009#then we don't actually have to make the shows.
S30E08_1011#We just need viewers to believe they can watch them.
S30E08_1013#Fake shows?
S30E08_1015#But what if people try to see them?
S30E08_1017#They won't, because recappers like you
S30E08_1019#will give those shows a B-minus.
S30E08_1021#No one ever watches a B-minus.
S30E08_1024#But, but that's crazy.
S30E08_1025#It could never work.
S30E08_1026#It already has.
S30E08_1028#Are you familiar with the USA Network?
S30E08_1032#Sure. Royal Pains, Suits, White Collar.
S30E08_1035#Have you ever seen any of those shows?
S30E08_1038#No, but somebody must have...
S30E08_1040#Surely somebody...
S30E08_1042#There is no USA Network.
S30E08_1044#There hasn't been for 20 years.
S30E08_1046#It's just bus ads!
S30E08_1048#Oh, my God.
S30E08_1050#Peak TV is a lie.
S30E08_1052#Your plan is insane.
S30E08_1054#Perhaps.
S30E08_1056#But not as insane as making...
S30E08_1058#that... many... shows.
S30E08_1062#I never had faith in God or family,
S30E08_1064#but I had faith in television.
S30E08_1067#And I won't let you do this to Him.
S30E08_1071#I have everything you said recapped right here.
S30E08_1074#And I'm gonna tell the whole world
S30E08_1076#every detail of your terrible plan.
S30E08_1080#Hey, there's half a birthday cake in the break room.
S30E08_1081#Mind if I...?
S30E08_1083#All right, I get it, I get it.
S30E08_1094#No, no, you can't close the circus.
S30E08_1096#There's got to be a way to keep this place running.
S30E08_1099#If we only had 50 grand, we could start over
S30E08_1101#with a new name and a new act.
S30E08_1103#Yeah. We can get the Flying Branzinos.
S30E08_1105#Nobody pickpockets a crowd like those guys.
S30E08_1109#But we don't have the 50 grand.
S30E08_1113#The circus is done.
S30E08_1116#No, no, listen.
S30E08_1119#I can get you your money.
S30E08_1121#With this.
S30E08_1123#You're gonna teach us to read?
S30E08_1125#No. I'm Krusty.
S30E08_1158#On the count of attempted murder of Homer Simpson,
S30E08_1160#the jury finds Herschel Krustofsky...
S30E08_1163#not guilty?
S30E08_1166#It was self-defense, Your Honor.
S30E08_1169#That recapper gave Krusty's show bad grades.
S30E08_1172#It was justifiable Homer-cide.
S30E08_1174#He gave Outlander a B-minus.
S30E08_1177#That show knows what it wants to be. Come on.
S30E08_1181#Ooh, I've heard that gets really good about eight episodes in.
S30E08_1184#Krusty, you're free to go.
S30E08_1190#Is there room on that train for one more clown?
S30E08_1194#Well, he did save the circus.
S30E08_1195#What do you say, Scuzzo?
S30E08_1197#Please, I'm not Krusty anymore.
S30E08_1200#I'm a circus clown.
S30E08_1202#I'm Soggy.
S30E08_1206#You're a, you're a TV clown.
S30E08_1208#The greatest TV clown I've ever had the honor to know.
S30E08_1211#But you're a traitor to our kind.
S30E08_1226#Goodbye, circus.
S30E08_1227#Goodbye.
S30E08_1237#Another terrible show.
S30E08_1239#Thanks a lot, Chris Pine.
S30E08_1243#And now the bad recap.
S30E08_1245#They always find some new chump to tear me down.
S30E08_1249#"A"? I got an "A"?
S30E08_1251#Everything I've ever done has been great!
S30E08_1253#I'll never be sad again.
S30E08_1256#"A" is for Ralph.
S30E09_128#We already ate them.
S30E09_129#No!
S30E09_131#Oh, I broke the cardinal rule,
S30E09_134#never invest in your own production.
S30E09_136#But I'm gonna take back my duct tape!
S30E09_141#And my bulbs. Ow, ow, ow. Hot, hot, hot.
S30E09_144#Am I acting? No.
S30E09_150#I'm stuck in my pork chop suit.
S30E09_153#I've become everything I hate.
S30E09_157#Huh? Oh. Uh, you were the best one, sweetie.
S30E09_160#Wha...? I didn't even get to do my line.
S30E09_163#Oh, I think I'm gonna cry.
S30E09_167#Oh, no. I hate to see a pork chop cry.
S30E09_183#Green! Green. Green. Green.
S30E09_187#Too late now, boy. Just, uh, play with the siren.
S30E09_196#76. 82. 79.
S30E09_199#Homer, that's the weather.
S30E09_204#Homer, I want you to do something with Lisa.
S30E09_207#I am.
S30E09_209#Isn't that right, honey? Oops.
S30E09_212#You're not speaking to her or even making eye contact.
S30E09_215#Oh, you'd be surprised at the things
S30E09_217#my eyes are in contact with.
S30E09_219#Okay. Well, what is she doing right now?
S30E09_222#Uh, uh... she's riding her pony?
S30E09_224#Uh, uh... blowing her clarinet?
S30E09_227#Ooh, ooh, ooh! Protesting a whale.
S30E09_229#I'm reading To Kill a Mockingbird.
S30E09_233#Now just remember, it's set in the South a long time ago.
S30E09_236#The terrible racism you're reading about
S30E09_239#is now everywhere.
S30E09_243#We're gonna shop at all the stores you like
S30E09_245#that have a chair I can sit in, except the chair store.
S30E09_248#I'm not allowed back there.
S30E09_250#Kent Brockman here interviewing three blue-collar men
S30E09_253#who voted for Trump. How do you feel now?
S30E09_255#- Please stop interviewing us. - Never.
S30E09_257#Here's the store.
S30E09_259#Let's get something sweet for my little girl.
S30E09_262#Sugar and spice and everything... What the?!
S30E09_265#"Twerking Girl"?
S30E09_267#"Ho, Sweet Ho"? "Baby's First Thong"?
S30E09_270#Those are just a few of our high-end brands.
S30E09_272#We also have "Call of Booty," "Raggedy Anorexic,"
S30E09_275#"The Edge of 13," And, for boys, "Jack the Stripper."
S30E09_277#Oh, for crying out loud.
S30E09_280#Okay, that's it. I've heard enough and three past that.
S30E09_283#My daughter is still a sweet little girl.
S30E09_286#What the? Oh, come on!
S30E09_291#My daughter's not a sex object. She's a respect object.
S30E09_297#Innocent girls.
S30E09_301#Knee socks.
S30E09_305#Grow up too fast.
S30E09_311#I will see you all in court.
S30E09_318#Dad, I'm seeing you through new eyes.
S30E09_321#You've become the hero of my book.
S30E09_323#The guy who kills the mockingbird?
S30E09_324#No one kills a mockingbird.
S30E09_326#Whoa, whoa, whoa, spoiler alert.
S30E09_327#You're like Atticus Finch,
S30E09_330#a modest, heroic man who stands up for what's right.
S30E09_333#Uh, yeah, sure.
S30E09_335#And I love the way you just made me feel safer.
S30E09_338#She respects me.
S30E09_340#This is even better than the time the Milk Duds
S30E09_343#in the vending machine knocked down a 3 Musketeers bar, too.
S30E09_346#Woo-hoo! Man beats machine!
S30E09_351#Well, I think that's all the reading
S30E09_353#for tonight, honey. It's getting late.
S30E09_354#What time is it?
S30E09_356#8:30.
S30E09_358#May I see your watch?
S30E09_368#"To Atticus, My Beloved Husband."
S30E09_372#Oh, black and white? The TV's broken.
S30E09_378#Hey, we were watching that.
S30E09_380#Whoa, look, it's Bart Simpson
S30E09_382#in his short pants on the davenport.
S30E09_385#Are you nuts?
S30E09_387#Homer is my hero.
S30E09_388#Say it in American.
S30E09_390#He stood up for me.
S30E09_391#It was magnificent.
S30E09_394#I wish my dad was a hero. 
S30E09_396#Wish granted, son!
S30E09_397#Now let's move it.
S30E09_399#If I hand out 5,000 flyers, I get all the turkey shreds
S30E09_402#I can dig out of the slicer trap.
S30E09_405#And dig I will.
S30E09_408#Well, I don't care if Dad's your hero.
S30E09_410#You know whose hero I am? Maggie's. Come here, girl.
S30E09_416#Okay, the dog's your hero, but I'm your human hero.
S30E09_419#Fine.
S30E09_420#But I'm your living human hero.
S30E09_422#Are you saying I'm dead? Put up your dukes.
S30E09_425#Now put up my dukes.
S30E09_429#Now take down your dukes.
S30E09_431#I'm the greatest!
S30E09_434#Oh... someone put down my dukes.
S30E09_453#I'd always liked my dad,
S30E09_455#but this was something new and wonderful.
S30E09_457#I admired him.
S30E09_459#The way he'd take me to the science museum once a year.
S30E09_473#And now we get ice cream.
S30E09_478#Oh, sweetie, it's starting to melt.
S30E09_480#Daddy will give you a little help.
S30E09_482#A little more help.
S30E09_485#A little more. A little more.
S30E09_487#Oops. Oh, Daddy ate yours. You can have mine.
S30E09_490#- Thank you. - Now let Daddy...
S30E09_491#I got it.
S30E09_497#And he inspired me in school.
S30E09_499#The second grade was grim,
S30E09_501#but Jem assured me that the older I get,
S30E09_503#the better school would be.
S30E09_505#Who says my class is grim? Who's Jem?
S30E09_507#What are you talking about?
S30E09_509#That's from To Kill a Mockingbird.
S30E09_511#Page 67. The book you assigned us to read.
S30E09_514#I assigned you to read the Wikipedia article.
S30E09_519#But my brother was not so happy.
S30E09_524#Mom, why can't we be like that?
S30E09_527#Well...
S30E09_533#I taste blue.
S30E09_535#Yeah, okay.
S30E09_541#I tell you, guys, having a kid that likes you
S30E09_543#is the greatest feeling in the world.
S30E09_545#I never got along with my old man.
S30E09_547#He was always disappointed I didn't follow him
S30E09_549#in the family business.
S30E09_551#- What did he do? - He was editor of Life magazine.
S30E09_553#I thought that was defunct. 
S30E09_554#Eh, he keeps saying a real son
S30E09_556#would've bought it out of bankruptcy
S30E09_558#and launched it as a digital platform.
S30E09_560#Well, angel funders want too much equity.
S30E09_562#Sorry, Dad.
S30E09_566#Yeah, my dad left when I was most vulnerable,
S30E09_569#the day after Mom left. That was a tough week there.
S30E09_577#Not a good time to film a commercial.
S30E09_580#Don't worry, we'll take these cameras
S30E09_582#and we'll make a Netflix documentary.
S30E09_585#They will buy anything!
S30E09_607#For dessert, I made blackberry pie.
S30E09_609#Oh, I made Dad a blueberry pie.
S30E09_612#Oh, what to do, what to do?
S30E09_616#In the words of King Solomon, I shall eat two pies.
S30E09_619#I don't think King Solomon said that.
S30E09_621#Maybe it was a king salmon.
S30E09_624#The point is, pies are good.
S30E09_629#Homer, I think Bart could use a little attention.
S30E09_633#Give attention to Lisa, give attention to Bart.
S30E09_635#What am I, made of attention?
S30E09_642#Okay, because of budget cutbacks,
S30E09_643#you got 45 seconds each.
S30E09_645#40 after the explanation. You, get in!
S30E09_647#What you're experiencing is a phenomenon
S30E09_648#known as transference, where you project your feelings
S30E09_650#towards your mother onto your art teacher.
S30E09_652#Anytime you find yourself wanting to hug Mrs. Hakamuchi,
S30E09_654#snap this rubber band on your wrist.
S30E09_656#Next!
S30E09_659#What are you waiting for? I'm here for an hour,
S30E09_660#then I'm off to 14 other schools.
S30E09_662#I eat lunch in my car 'cause they won't let me
S30E09_663#counsel kids with food in my mouth.
S30E09_665#Well, I always thought my dad was a big fat loser
S30E09_667#until he started giving attention to my lame-o sister.
S30E09_669#So why do I want his attention now?
S30E09_670#Why does this hurt?
S30E09_671#Family members are locked into roles.
S30E09_672#Change that, and what do you get?
S30E09_673#Resentment and acting out.
S30E09_675#Acting out can take many forms,
S30E09_676#from pouting to armed robbery.
S30E09_677#-Time's almost up. -So, what do I do?
S30E09_678#You have no choice.
S30E09_680#Act out until somebody pays attention to you.
S30E09_681#Next!
S30E09_684#Okay, couples therapy. You got 90 seconds.
S30E09_686#I'm the oldest, and she won't admit it.
S30E09_691#Milhouse, I'm about to act out.
S30E09_693#After we leave an envelope full of guilt.
S30E09_696#Also, we're stopping by the photo booth
S30E09_698#and the perfume room.
S30E09_699#Enough.
S30E09_710#Come on, sweetie, pick up the pace.
S30E09_712#The sushi's been sitting out for an hour.
S30E09_715#When Willie turned 13, it was time to work in the mines.
S30E09_718#It's go time.
S30E09_723#Help. My friend's having an asthma attack.
S30E09_725#Not yet, Bart. This is a real one.
S30E09_728#Even better.
S30E09_732#Please, we've got to get him to the hospital.
S30E09_735#Wow. I'm gonna meet a nurse.
S30E09_747#And now we're gonna party like it's 5799.
S30E09_750#Wait, wait, wait.
S30E09_751#Before you leave, I am going to talk.
S30E09_756#And I'm going to tell you a very long joke.
S30E09_758#Please stand.
S30E09_763#So, an old rabbi was confronted with squirrels
S30E09_765#in the attic.
S30E09_767#Get to the punch line or your son flunks geometry.
S30E09_769#He gave the squirrels a bar mitzvah
S30E09_770#and never saw them in temple again.
S30E09_771#Amen.
S30E09_778#I don't drive a minivan.
S30E09_780#Do I look like a suburban soccer mom from Phoenix?
S30E09_783#Well, sometimes, when you're tired.
S30E09_784#Shut up!
S30E09_786#I should be first. I own a Tesla.
S30E09_788#Those are my keys.
S30E09_790#Prepare for the boning of your life.
S30E09_797#To repeat, I own a Tesla,
S30E09_799#and I'm going to use "Summon."
S30E09_806#Who is responsible for this meshugana behavior?
S30E09_809#He did it.
S30E09_831#Hey, Mr. Cunningham.
S30E09_834#I said hey, Mr. Cunningham.
S30E09_835#I didn't do it. Nobody saw me do it.
S30E09_837#They know I did it. Protect me, Dad.
S30E09_839#Don't you remember me, Mr. Cunningham?
S30E09_842#I'm Jean Louise Finch.
S30E09_851#Where's your boy?
S30E09_853#What's your hurry, friend?
S30E09_855#Now, Homer, don't you try to disarm us
S30E09_859#with your genteel mannerisms of a bygone era there.
S30E09_863#Why, I haven't a notion as to what you are importuning,
S30E09_866#good sir.
S30E09_880#Excuse me, Mr. Szyslak.
S30E09_882#Mr. Szyslak, we know you.
S30E09_885#My father likes to drink at your bar.
S30E09_888#You can't say hi to me?
S30E09_892#And how 'bout you, Chief Wiggum?
S30E09_894#I go to school with your boy, Ralph.
S30E09_896#Give my regards to Ralph, would you, please?
S30E09_900#All right, let's go, people. They've defused us.
S30E09_902#Everyone get, uh, get one last mutter in.
S30E09_909#Oh, Lisa, sweetie, you saved me.
S30E09_911#No, Dad, you saved us all
S30E09_914#with your calmness and bravery.
S30E09_916#- Thanks. Just one thing. - Yes, Dad?
S30E09_918#Don't tell your mother about the mob
S30E09_920#that almost killed your brother.
S30E09_922#She's taken a liking to him.
S30E09_923#The what?
S30E09_925#You're hearing things in the shower again, Marge.
S30E09_927#Oh, okay.
S30E09_931#Sorry.
S30E09_939#Okay, Maggie, you give me your binky,
S30E09_942#and I'll give you this substitution bear doll.
S30E09_949#You can't beat addiction, Marge.
S30E09_951#I got addicted to Agatha Christie books.
S30E09_955#I always thought the murderer was that know-it-all Belgian.
S30E09_958#Turns out, he was the detective.
S30E09_960#41 books, and I never saw it coming.
S30E09_966#- What happened? - Got in a fight.
S30E09_968#Why? What did the other kid do?
S30E09_970#Said Dad was lazy and incompetent.
S30E09_972#And where is this other kid?
S30E09_975#You got in a fight with your brother?
S30E09_977#I won a fight with my brother.
S30E09_979#- Liar. - Let's go again.
S30E09_980#Stop her, Mom.
S30E09_985#To combat bed-wetting, doctors recommend
S30E09_987#shifting times for drinking, scheduling bathroom breaks,
S30E09_988#and being encouraging. I'll deny having said this,
S30E09_990#but the next time you wet your bed, have 'em spank you.
S30E09_991#Next.
S30E09_994#Wait, you're not a kid. Doesn't matter.
S30E09_995#You've got 45 seconds. Go.
S30E09_997#I'm worried that my daughter is ruining her family
S30E09_1000#idolizing her father.
S30E09_1002#I see. Wow. Marge, it's totally normal
S30E09_1004#for a little girl to be infatuated with her father.
S30E09_1005#It's safe and comes from a good place,
S30E09_1007#and when it ends, it's another thing she'll blame you for.
S30E09_1009#Yes, well, I'm afraid my husband isn't always
S30E09_1012#a perfect influence.
S30E09_1015#Marge, I've got a legal matter to deal with.
S30E09_1017#I'll be outside.
S30E09_1022#Also, I'm worried that my son is feeling neglected.
S30E09_1024#Your husband has to give your daughter the perfect speech,
S30E09_1026#which lets her down but doesn't snap her in two.
S30E09_1028#And make sure you don't have any more kids.
S30E09_1029#Sounds like it'll be a disaster.
S30E09_1033#Whoa, nice to meet you. See you in three years.
S30E09_1034#Now, good-bye.
S30E09_1040#- Homer? - Huh? What?
S30E09_1042#Homer, it's sweet that Lisa idolizes you,
S30E09_1045#but I think it's gone too far.
S30E09_1046#You're right.
S30E09_1048#Tell her she's right.
S30E09_1049#I just did.
S30E09_1051#I'm on a five-second delay.
S30E09_1053#The kids are at each other's throats.
S30E09_1055#Look, you can't be my dog and hers; pick a side.
S30E09_1060#You can't hide in there forever.
S30E09_1065#Okay, I'll talk to Bart, you talk to Lisa.
S30E09_1067#We've got to put this family back in place.
S30E09_1070#Okay. Why do you always tell me
S30E09_1072#the most important things just when I'm about to fall asleep?
S30E09_1076#Because I think the pillow talk between a woman and her husband
S30E09_1079#is the most important...
S30E09_1082#What? How did I wind up in church?
S30E09_1087#What's wrong, sweetie?
S30E09_1089#I've got that terrible feeling where I'm almost
S30E09_1091#at the end of a great book,
S30E09_1093#and once I finish, it's over forever.
S30E09_1096#Well, that's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about.
S30E09_1099#You and I have had a lot of fun these past few weeks,
S30E09_1102#but you aren't always gonna look up to your dad
S30E09_1104#as much as you do now.
S30E09_1105#Bup, bup, bup. Great man,
S30E09_1107#there is nothing you could do to make me lose one iota
S30E09_1110#of respect for you.
S30E09_1117#When I was a kid, I wanted to be that guy,
S30E09_1119#but now I can't fit behind a door.
S30E09_1121#You'll discover I'm not the perfect man you think.
S30E09_1124#Okay, I'll finish my book.
S30E09_1126#But always remember you're my dad,
S30E09_1129#and I'll never forget the way you and...
S30E09_1133#Damn it.
S30E09_1137#I'm home!
S30E09_1142#She's moved on,
S30E09_1144#which, let's face it, is the way things should be.
S30E09_1146#Kids grow up, daddies die,
S30E09_1148#and then the wind whispers, "Why?"
S30E09_1153#Oh, I don't know. I've been hurt before.
S30E09_1155#I don't want to mess you up by getting close to you.
S30E09_1168#No problem.
S30E09_1170#Marge, get in here.
S30E09_1175#Okay Bart, because we treasure you too,
S30E09_1178#I'm gonna let you do one thing just for yourself.
S30E09_1180#Kick Homer in the butt?
S30E09_1182#Uh, why don't you give it some thought.
S30E09_1185#Kick Lisa in the butt.
S30E09_1186#Have a birthday party every day?
S30E09_1188#Never brush my teeth again.
S30E09_1190#Be homeschooled by the dog.
S30E09_1191#Drive a tank through Skinner's house.
S30E09_1193#Open a casino in the basement.
S30E09_1195#Have an affair?
S30E09_1197#- You haven't decided yet?  - Don't rush me.
S30E09_1200#Convert my Roth IRA to a 401K?
S30E09_1201#Have an affair?
S30E09_1202#Take a mulligan?
S30E09_1204#Okay, I've decided.
S30E09_1206#I'll kick Homer in the butt.
S30E09_1209#You can kick it if you can find it.
S28E20_71#*People know the part*
S28E20_73#*I'm playing*
S28E20_76#*Paid for every dance...*
S28E20_78#Showtime.
S28E20_80#*Ooh, and they're sayin'*
S28E20_81#*Gigolo, gigolo, gigolo...*
S28E20_83#Your tea, Nana.
S28E20_86#Sweet darling boy.
S28E20_87#I know what you're thinking.
S28E20_89#This must be some kind of prank.
S28E20_91#Is there laxative in the punch bowl?
S28E20_94#Well, there is, but their doctors prescribed that.
S28E20_96#I've changed.
S28E20_97#I've become pinchable.
S28E20_98#You look confused.
S28E20_100#Why don't I start from the beginning?
S28E20_104#*Grandpa, Grandma*
S28E20_105#*We love you*
S28E20_107#*We will show what school can do*
S28E20_110#*We cleaned our desk, we learned this song*
S28E20_113#*Teachers beat us when you're gone*
S28E20_116#*Grandma, grandpa, you're the best*
S28E20_119#*Now you can be laid to rest.*
S28E20_123#Simpson. Those lyrics are unapproved and not that funny.
S28E20_125#Come with me.
S28E20_126#Hey, Skinner.
S28E20_128#Sure you're tough enough to punish a little boy.
S28E20_130#But what about a Marine Corps veteran?
S28E20_137#Okay, Seymour.
S28E20_138#Note to my mom or detention?
S28E20_141#Which of your two lame weapons are you gonna unleash on me?
S28E20_144#I have other weapons.
S28E20_146#I have no other weapons.
S28E20_148#Seymour, walk me to the bus stop.
S28E20_149#Mother, what are you doing here?
S28E20_151#I wanted to make sure you remember
S28E20_153#that I think your job is stupid.
S28E20_161#Simpson, I thought of your punishment.
S28E20_163#Bart here will walk you to the bus stop.
S28E20_166#That'll kill two birds with one stone.
S28E20_168#First time a worm ever killed a bird.
S28E20_173#Okay, Lenny, don't be nervous.
S28E20_175#This is the big one.
S28E20_180#Gotcha! Where am I?
S28E20_182#You walked in the core.
S28E20_184#Yeah, we better seal this thing up tight.
S28E20_192#I'm playing Peekimon Get, see?
S28E20_194#That's a wild Rotata.
S28E20_197#That has got to be the stupidest game I've ever heard of.
S28E20_200#Oh, yeah, you're right. It's really a kids' game.
S28E20_201#And it's silly for me to...
S28E20_203#Quiet, I'm playing it.
S28E20_207#Quitting time.
S28E20_209#Three-day weekend.
S28E20_216#*Bart's holding hands*
S28E20_218#*With an old lady*
S28E20_220#*Who seems kind of sweet*
S28E20_223#*And my grandmas are gone*
S28E20_225#*One's in jail, and one's in dirt jail.*
S28E20_229#Back in a flash, Grandmama.
S28E20_231#Try not to win any beauty pageants while I'm gone.
S28E20_237#Agnes!
S28E20_239#Oh, you just missed my perfect little Martin.
S28E20_242#Eh, I saw him.
S28E20_244#He's beefing up, that's for sure.
S28E20_246#Don't you love Grandparents' Day?
S28E20_248#I get to meet all the little boys Martin snitches on.
S28E20_251#Is that your grandson?
S28E20_253#Or is this just a, a pity walk?
S28E20_255#- He's not... - A pity walker?
S28E20_257#I love my Gam-Gam.
S28E20_259#You hear that?
S28E20_260#Gam-Gam.
S28E20_261#What's your pet name?
S28E20_262#Gram-Gram.
S28E20_264#That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
S28E20_267#I can't believe Martin left you alone
S28E20_270#in this cold hallway.
S28E20_271#Thanks, Peaches.
S28E20_273#You're a gift to this world.
S28E20_275#You deserve to be wrapped up, Gam-Gam.
S28E20_277#Gam-Gam-Gam.
S28E20_278#Gam-Gam-Gam.
S28E20_280#For you, Grandmama.
S28E20_283#A diorama of the sky from the night you were born.
S28E20_285#Give me your sweater.
S28E20_287#But, but without it, I'm nippley.
S28E20_292#You hear that? Oh, no...
S28E20_294#Nippley.
S28E20_298#I always wanted a grandson.
S28E20_302#A cute little guy I could take to the circus, and the movies.
S28E20_305#Someone I could spoil rotten.
S28E20_307#I'm halfway there, ma'am.
S28E20_309#Well, this is my bus.
S28E20_312#Goes right by the candy store, eh?
S28E20_316#Don't take my mother, I need her to make me French toast!
S28E20_319#Egg yolks scare me...
S28E20_328#A Rattlesnitch.
S28E20_335#Got it.
S28E20_337#- Got it. - Lo tango.
S28E20_339#Duffman has got it.
S28E20_340#Got it.
S28E20_342#- Got it. - Got it.
S28E20_343#Got it.
S28E20_344#Got it.
S28E20_345#- Got it. - Got it.
S28E20_347#Now that's a spicy Peekiball.
S28E20_349#Got it.
S28E20_352#And so... aw, I didn't get it.
S28E20_354#Won't anyone help me?
S28E20_357#Got it, and no.
S28E20_362#Now Maggie, there's no monster under your bed.
S28E20_365#Ooh, there is one on your face.
S28E20_369#Oh, man, there's like a million in here.
S28E20_371#Here's the phone, so you can see them.
S28E20_372#Nighty night.
S28E20_379#In the gospel according to Luke, uh...
S28E20_382#If you two don't mind.
S28E20_385#Look this game is, or at least was, bigger than Jesus, okay?
S28E20_389#That's a pretty low bar these days.
S28E20_393#Skunk-a-san.
S28E20_396#Why can't I capture you?
S28E20_398#It's real!
S28E20_400#D'oh!
S28E20_406#Sprayed by a skunk.
S28E20_408#Homie, that game's too dangerous.
S28E20_410#The game was fine.
S28E20_412#Reality was dangerous.
S28E20_413#And could you move a little to your left?
S28E20_415#There's a Stumble-Bee right behind you.
S28E20_417#Is there any fad you don't take too far?
S28E20_419#The aerobics ones.
S28E20_421#Mom, what Dad could use is a co-player,
S28E20_423#who makes sure he doesn't get hurt.
S28E20_425#Because the game is good for him.
S28E20_427#You can see that he's lost weight from the walking.
S28E20_430#I'm using the factory holes on my belt.
S28E20_434#Lisa, why are you interested?
S28E20_437#Because it's the greatest game ever.
S28E20_439#In this world, I can throw a ball.
S28E20_441#Hmm, okay.
S28E20_445#I'd prefer if you didn't turn your skunk bath
S28E20_448#into a giant cocktail.
S28E20_451#Ugh. One damn rule after another around here.
S28E20_455#Peekisaurus at the Kwik-E-Mart.
S28E20_458#Please come in.
S28E20_460#Enjoy your game from which I do not make a dime.
S28E20_463#I'll be darned if this little critter
S28E20_464#doesn't look like your god.
S28E20_466#And I'll be darned if this sad wino
S28E20_468#doesn't look like your god.
S28E20_471#Do unto Snickers as you would have Snickers do unto you.
S28E20_478#Well.
S28E20_480#Such good manners.
S28E20_482#I went out to get you some sneakers.
S28E20_484#The kind that gang members wear.
S28E20_487#Heaven. But I couldn't help thinking,
S28E20_489#why settle for one golden goose,
S28E20_490#when you can have a gaggle?
S28E20_493#Bessie, have I seen your grandkids in church?
S28E20_497#No. I don't have any grandchildren.
S28E20_498#Here's my headshot.
S28E20_502#In fights with your children, I take your side.
S28E20_505#And what's this?
S28E20_508#I have a loose tooth.
S28E20_517#It might've felt more like a lie
S28E20_519#if I had to say the word "Grandmother."
S28E20_522#Fortunately, my ladies like to be called anything but.
S28E20_526#Good morning, Momo.
S28E20_528#I love you, Geema.
S28E20_529#Momtom!
S28E20_531#Na-nee!
S28E20_532#Ugogo!
S28E20_533#Waipo.
S28E20_535#Hey, who wants a box full of firecrackers?
S28E20_538#They won't light up the night like you.
S28E20_543#Man, nothing beats ladies in their 80s.
S28E20_545#Twice my age plus 60.
S28E20_546#Perfect.
S28E20_574#Ketchup? In my kitchen?
S28E20_575#Never!
S28E20_582#Bart?
S28E20_583#Hey, Mom. Want a pep-o-mint drop?
S28E20_586#Yes, but since when do you carry those?
S28E20_588#Oh, I got it all.
S28E20_590#Altoids, butterscotch candy,
S28E20_592#Jelly Bellies, and Turkish delight.
S28E20_595#Hello?
S28E20_597#It's someone named Gertie.
S28E20_599#Is that a girl in your class?
S28E20_600#I know a lot of Gerties.
S28E20_602#Did it sound like she was talking through her throat?
S28E20_604#Uh, I'll just give you the phone.
S28E20_607#Hello, sweetie, I didn't know
S28E20_609#if you wanted PlayStation or Xbox,
S28E20_612#so I got both.
S28E20_617#Maw-maw? I ordered so many toys,
S28E20_619#you get free shipping.
S28E20_620#Oh, so thoughtful.
S28E20_623#Interested? My card.
S28E20_624#Book now for Christmas.
S28E20_627#I was juggling 50 shades of gray.
S28E20_629#I've been watching you.
S28E20_631#I know exactly what you're up to.
S28E20_633#I'm not up to anything, lady.
S28E20_636#This is for you.
S28E20_638#Thanks for coming to my brother's wake.
S28E20_641#It's what I do.
S28E20_648#You are a cold little customer.
S28E20_650#Agreed. Now, are we done here?
S28E20_652#Because I've got birthday checks to deposit.
S28E20_654#I've got birthdays like Lindy's has pickles.
S28E20_657#Do you even know what that means? Do you?
S28E20_660#What is this? Pick On the Con Artist Day?
S28E20_662#I'll pay you $100 to pick me up, four days in a row,
S28E20_665#from the Sunnyday Nursing Home.
S28E20_667#Sunnyday, that's on Fifth, right?
S28E20_669#Yes. Ask for Phoebe Pratt.
S28E20_672#Oh, my dear, you look like Cybil Shepherd.
S28E20_675#I am Cybil Shepherd.
S28E20_677#Impossible, Cybil Shepherd is notoriously difficult.
S28E20_681#Oh, my God, everyone, it's Cybil Shepherd!
S28E20_693#So, it turns out you can buy Peeky creatures with real money.
S28E20_696#But the fun of the game is catching them, not buying them.
S28E20_699#Lisa, I can think of no better investment
S28E20_701#than invisible creatures that are part of an over-hyped,
S28E20_703#passing fad.
S28E20_704#- Please? - I'm in.
S28E20_706#You know, I'm really starting to like you.
S28E20_712#I'm here for Phoebe.
S28E20_714#Weren't you just here for Eunice?
S28E20_716#Hey, a guy can have two grandmothers.
S28E20_717#Look it up.
S28E20_720#All right, you've served your purpose.
S28E20_721#Good-bye.
S28E20_722#A hundred bucks to walk you to the curb?
S28E20_724#Sunnyday is a secure facility.
S28E20_726#A family member must sign me out.
S28E20_729#Why are you there? You seem normal.
S28E20_732#Happy anniversary. Got it!
S28E20_734#My family fear I'll wander off into some forest.
S28E20_737#So where are you going?
S28E20_738#Well, that forest over there.
S28E20_740#I better come with you.
S28E20_741#Those woods are full of bullies.
S28E20_743#So, did you get it?
S28E20_745#Yep, here's the orzo.
S28E20_747#You idiot, you were supposed to get ouzo.
S28E20_750#Orzo is, like, thick, brown rice.
S28E20_752#You're like thick, brown rice.
S28E20_758#It's good stuff.
S28E20_762#So, Pheebs, tell me about yourself.
S28E20_764#I'm a nature photographer.
S28E20_766#Wow, two things that won't exist in 20 years.
S28E20_775#Oh, you're quite good at taking the piss out of someone.
S28E20_778#Wait, that's okay to say?
S28E20_779#Taking the piss.
S28E20_781#Taking the piss. Taking the piss, taking the piss.
S28E20_783#*Taking the piss.*
S28E20_785#Have you gotten that out of your system?
S28E20_787#I'll get up in the middle of the night and say one more.
S28E20_789#Poor old buck.
S28E20_792#Probably the last spring he'll make it up the mountain.
S28E20_794#Want me to throw a rock at it?
S28E20_795#No!
S28E20_798#He'll know when his time has come.
S28E20_800#We all do.
S28E20_804#I got to be me.
S28E20_807#Right, it's been four days.
S28E20_808#As we agreed.
S28E20_811#Um, I don't feel right taking your money.
S28E20_817#I bequeath this to you.
S28E20_818#"Bequeath"?
S28E20_820#- What does that mean? - Oh, look it up.
S28E20_822#Good-bye, Bart.
S28E20_829#I'm having brunch with my little man and I need the bus pass.
S28E20_832#Mother, you know that boy is a ne'er-do-well
S28E20_834#and possibly a scofflaw.
S28E20_836#Seymour, it's time you lived your life.
S28E20_841#I will live my life.
S28E20_843#And I'll start by leaving my hair mussed up.
S28E20_846#And comb that hair.
S28E20_848#I'll finger-comb it, is what I'll do.
S28E20_850#Oh, bequeath...
S28E20_851#Bequeath, bequeath.
S28E20_853#I can't believe she's making me do this.
S28E20_854#I'm gonna look up a word.
S28E20_856#How do you look up a word?
S28E20_859#I'd like to look up a word.
S28E20_860#Give me your phone.
S28E20_862#- What's the word? - "Bequeath."
S28E20_866#This means something you give away when you die.
S28E20_868#She must be sick.
S28E20_869#How much do I owe you?
S28E20_870#Oh, no, it's...
S28E20_871#five dollars.
S28E20_878#I'm here to see Phoebe, it's kind of a surprise.
S28E20_880#But she left this morning.
S28E20_881#She said you were waiting outside
S28E20_883#and I didn't bother to check.
S28E20_885#What kind of a nursing home are you running here?
S28E20_888#Is it panic you want?
S28E20_890#Patient missing! Patient missing!
S28E20_892#What's with you, Judy?
S28E20_894#He knows my name.
S28E20_899#Those tracks were made by tennis balls, Lou.
S28E20_902#Get me files on Pete Sampras
S28E20_904#and the Williams sisters.
S28E20_906#I realized she had me pick her up four days in a row
S28E20_908#so the home's guard would be down
S28E20_910#and she could leave on her own.
S28E20_911#But why?
S28E20_914#He'll know when his time has come.
S28E20_916#We all do.
S28E20_918#Can't believe I missed that.
S28E20_920#Or this.
S28E20_922#Don't tell anyone, I plan to off myself.
S28E20_928#Okay, these Peekimon cheats cost us 600 bucks.
S28E20_931#No one but you or I must know.
S28E20_936#I'm starting to suspect that trophy was not real gold.
S28E20_939#Can we talk about something else?
S28E20_940#Absolutely.
S28E20_942#After you put your fingerprints on this knife.
S28E20_944#Dad!
S28E20_945#It's a cake knife.
S28E20_946#I just had an extra piece.
S28E20_947#Two extra pieces.
S28E20_949#Okay, two extra cakes.
S28E20_951#But all cakes are pieces of something bigger.
S28E20_952#Just touch the knife.
S28E20_955#Dad, why are you making me hide things from Mom?
S28E20_957#You're right.
S28E20_958#That's my job.
S28E20_959#Well, it's my fault too.
S28E20_961#No, sweetie, no more secrets.
S28E20_963#From now on we're an open book.
S28E20_965#- Guys! - How much did you hear?
S28E20_967#We may have to get rid of the boy.
S28E20_968#I don't know what you're talking about.
S28E20_970#I need you to look for something. 
S28E20_973#Forget it. I learned from Peekimon that's a slippery slope.
S28E20_977#Especially that time I fell down a slippery slope.
S28E20_979#Look, this isn't a stupid game.
S28E20_981#I'm looking for a lady who may be in trouble.
S28E20_983#- Is it Patty? - No.
S28E20_984#- Is it Selma? - No!
S28E20_985#Let's roll.
S28E20_988#This is where we used to go.
S28E20_990#Bart, what were you up to?
S28E20_992#Being the perfect grandson.
S28E20_993#For our grandma?
S28E20_995#No, for everybody but her.
S28E20_997#Now please, we got to find Phoebe.
S28E20_999#Well, we'll need the help of...
S28E20_1002#experienced Peekimon searchers.
S28E20_1005#This is who we're looking for.
S28E20_1007#Oh, you're no fun.
S28E20_1009#What's her Peeki-name?
S28E20_1012#Dame Judi Dentures.
S28E20_1015#And her point value?
S28E20_1016#I don't know, a zillion?
S28E20_1019#Okay, let's do it.
S28E20_1024#*I want to be the very best*
S28E20_1027#*This is my new career*
S28E20_1031#*And then take a long, long rest*
S28E20_1034#*And celebrate with beer*
S28E20_1037#*I will travel across the land*
S28E20_1040#*Catching beasts who've done no crime*
S28E20_1044#*Playing games made in Japan*
S28E20_1047#*I love to waste my time*
S28E20_1051#*This is fun for everyone*
S28E20_1054#*Even babies play the game*
S28E20_1056#*Maggie cannot*
S28E20_1058#*Say a word*
S28E20_1060#*But watch her stab and kill and maim*
S28E20_1066#I found something.
S28E20_1070#Peekimon searchers, huh?
S28E20_1072#Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever...
S28E20_1073#Found her!
S28E20_1074#Oh, my God.
S28E20_1081#Hello.
S28E20_1083#Oh, I-I seemed to have fallen asleep...
S28E20_1084#in this forest...
S28E20_1086#with apparently excellent Wi-Fi.
S28E20_1089#Uh, yes, all the trees are cell phone towers.
S28E20_1092#What are you doing out here?
S28E20_1095#Oh... I'll-I'll admit, I-I had some dark thoughts
S28E20_1098#and I used you to escape from the home.
S28E20_1101#But once I got out here by myself, completely free,
S28E20_1104#I realized there's so much to live for.
S28E20_1107#And... I want my camera back.
S28E20_1109#Can we still hike sometimes?
S28E20_1112#Yes, and we could go inside that mill house you love so much.
S28E20_1115#Milhouse is not a place, it's a nerd.
S28E20_1117#Oh, well, there you go.
S28E20_1118#So that's it.
S28E20_1121#I learned playing with women's hearts is a dangerous game.
S28E20_1124#And it's wrong to take advantage of the elderly.
S28E20_1128#And Grampa?
S28E20_1131#I'm sorry I embarrassed you on Grandparents' Day.
S28E20_1134#Jeez! I thought my stories were long.
S28E20_1142#- Homer? - Oh... what?
S28E20_1144#I know about the $600.
S28E20_1146#You're right, Marge.
S28E20_1148#We spent too much.
S28E20_1149#Bart was a gigolo.
S28E20_1150#What are you gonna do?
S28E20_1152#Be mad at the world?
S28E20_1153#Maybe you could say something
S28E20_1155#to make me feel better.
S28E20_1156#The kids are fine.
S28E20_1158#The game is a fad and, in no time at all,
S28E20_1161#you'll be worried about something else.
S28E20_1164#Huh, I do feel better.
S28E20_1167#Hmm, you know, the last couple of pies I baked
S28E20_1169#haven't been great.
S28E20_1171#There you go.
S28E20_1183#I like your hair. Finger-combed?
S28E20_1186#Yes, because I decide how my hair looks.
S28E20_1188#Seymour!
S28E20_1190#Just wanted to tell you I'm here with a real man.
S28E20_1192#My silhouette's replacing yours on the stairs.
S28E20_1197#So enjoy your meal, son.
S28E20_1198#I'm buying dessert.
S28E20_1200#Oh, that's so nice.
S28E20_1201#For you,
S28E20_1203#not that son-snatcher.
S28E20_1215#*I want to be the very best*
S28E20_1218#*This is my new career*
S28E20_1222#*I want to give this game a rest*
S28E20_1224#*I've been playing since last year*
S28E20_1228#*I play it on my little boat*
S28E20_1231#*Sitting in a cove*
S28E20_1235#*I ran my bus right off a cliff*
S28E20_1238#*Was playing while I drove*
S28E20_1241#*This fad was hot*
S28E20_1243#*And then was not*
S28E20_1245#*These things come and go*
S28E20_1248#*All I know is once again*
S28E20_1251#*I wasted lots of dough*
S30E10_130#Yeah, well, we'll think about it.
S30E10_136#I want everything about Christmas to be perfect,
S30E10_140#but that smart TV the kids want is $2,400.
S30E10_143#That's ridiculous.
S30E10_145#Our TV may not be smart, but it's street smart.
S30E10_149#It's Sprawl-Mart's huge Black Friday sale.
S30E10_151#Jay-G headphones only $49.99.
S30E10_153#Two-piece sofa set only $249.99.
S30E10_156#And this GL50 9K Smart TV only $499.99.
S30E10_161#GL50 9K Smart TV. Where have I heard that before?
S30E10_164#The kids are chanting it nonstop.
S30E10_167#GL50 9K Smart TV.
S30E10_170#GL50 9K Smart TV
S30E10_172#Knock it off!
S30E10_173#Supplies are limited,
S30E10_174#so be here when the doors open at 6:00 a.M.!
S30E10_176#Black Friday: like The Purge, but for bargains.
S30E10_179#That's how we get it. We have to go.
S30E10_182#Oh, old TV, you really are dumb.
S30E10_185#You just told us how to replace you.
S30E10_189#Why do we have an antenna on an HDTV?
S30E10_191#I thought it looked cool.
S30E10_195#So the customers will be entering from here,
S30E10_197#here and here.
S30E10_199#Our biggest concern are the cutsies.
S30E10_201#- I hate those Nazis. - I said "Cutsies."
S30E10_204#You think the Nazis didn't take cuts?
S30E10_208#I leave for Sprawl-Mart now, getting us a good place in line.
S30E10_211#And I go to sleep now, waking up in the middle of the night,
S30E10_214#rested and ready to relieve you at 3:00 a.m.
S30E10_216#That's right.
S30E10_219#Godspeed, hot woman.
S30E10_226#I love you, too, Homie, but I have to go.
S30E10_229#My tongue is frozen to your zipper.
S30E10_241#Aw, Marge, great to see you out here.
S30E10_244#You want a Cup O' Noodles to chase away the chill?
S30E10_246#- How sweet. - It's just water.
S30E10_248#I can't afford the real thing,
S30E10_250#but if you stare at the label while you drink it,
S30E10_253#you'd swear there was real chicken powder in there.
S30E10_259#What bargain are you busting down the door for?
S30E10_263#I'm getting a Futon Friend for my granddaughter.
S30E10_266#I want her to remember me as more than just a grandpa
S30E10_267#who lives at the airport.
S30E10_269#The trick is to carry a piece of empty luggage
S30E10_272#because then they... they...
S30E10_286#Sorry, Ralphie, it's just too cold.
S30E10_288#Even my blubber isn't helping.
S30E10_291#Cold in the winter, hot in the summer.
S30E10_293#Why did I grow you?
S30E10_298#Oh, your hands feel cold. Let me look at them.
S30E10_302#Whoa, that's toasty! Am in Ipanema?
S30E10_311#I can do this. It's 2:30.
S30E10_312#Homer's gonna be here any minute.
S30E10_320#What?
S30E10_327#What the...?
S30E10_329#Ooh, got to relieve Marge!
S30E10_342#My hands are starting to freeze.
S30E10_345#I hope Homer gets here soon.
S30E10_347#Why are we standing?
S30E10_349#We still have hours before the store opens.
S30E10_351#To keep out the cutters.
S30E10_353#Ow! You're punching me in the back.
S30E10_354#I ain't doin' it.
S30E10_356#It's the baby what's in my belly thrashing about.
S30E10_359#If you go into labor, I'll help you deliver,
S30E10_361#but then that baby has to go to the back of the line.
S30E10_363#Yeah!
S30E10_365#I know how to hold a baby in.
S30E10_374#Have a safe Black Friday,
S30E10_377#and welcome to Thunderdome.
S30E10_391#My hands are frozen,
S30E10_393#which makes it easier to do this.
S30E10_402#The electronics department.
S30E10_403#I'm going to make it.
S30E10_405#I'm not gonna make it!
S30E10_410#Is there one drop of humanity in this big-box store?
S30E10_415#Don't look, Marge. At any other time of year,
S30E10_417#that man's life would be worth more than a TV,
S30E10_420#but not at Christmas.
S30E10_422#Tell my granddaughter I existed.
S30E10_454#This will help raise the little one.
S30E10_456#*Jangle bells, jangle bells*
S30E10_458#*We gots a TV*
S30E10_461#*Now the only thing we lack*
S30E10_463#*Is e-lectricity, hey!*
S30E10_465#You did it, Marge.
S30E10_468#You've given a poor old man the greatest gift of all,
S30E10_470#a grandchild's love.
S30E10_472#Well, that makes it all...
S30E10_473#I can't leave without one of those.
S30E10_475#I'll give you a hundred bucks for it.
S30E10_477#Can't say no to that.
S30E10_485#Oh! Marge, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to let you down.
S30E10_489#I'm not mad at you. I won't let myself be mad at you.
S30E10_492#This is Christmas, and Christmas is great for our kids,
S30E10_495#and I vow on my life
S30E10_497#to make it a great Christmas.
S30E10_499#I totally agree.
S30E10_501#Now because you've been through so much, let me drive.
S30E10_509#Let me call you an Uber.
S30E10_518#So I'm afraid you won't be getting
S30E10_521#the smart TV for Christmas.
S30E10_522#We figured.
S30E10_524#Never get your hopes up around here.
S30E10_527#But I promise you, Christmas will be better than ever.
S30E10_530#I'll sweep that up, sweetie.
S30E10_535#Your mother froze her fingers
S30E10_538#trying to get a Christmas gift for you,
S30E10_539#and what were you going to give her?
S30E10_541#- Lanyard. - Poem.
S30E10_543#I thought as much.
S30E10_545#Well, we're gonna make this Christmas about your mother.
S30E10_548#- But Christmas is for kids. - Her.
S30E10_551#Hi, guys, it's Monica here
S30E10_553#with five easy hacks for resetting
S30E10_554#your threshold Christmas caroler.
S30E10_557#Number one, locate the P.I.X. input on the pressure strip.
S30E10_560#I already did that, Monica.
S30E10_564#I think I've got it.
S30E10_566#What if we take Mom on a Florida vacation for Christmas?
S30E10_571#I ride on a pig.
S30E10_573#Don't forget to leave me porridge!
S30E10_576#Ugh, I've got it set on Norwegian.
S30E10_579#Well, at least we're not planning a vacation
S30E10_581#at the last second, we're planning at the last minute.
S30E10_584#Can't afford Nine Flags Underwater,
S30E10_586#Yankees Fantasy Camp,
S30E10_588#Yankees Suck Fantasy Camp...
S30E10_591#Oh, my God, there's a place we can afford.
S30E10_593#I've never heard of it.
S30E10_595#How can we be sure it's what it seems in the ad?
S30E10_598#That's a good point. On the other hand...
S30E10_599#only three rooms left!
S30E10_602#And 58 people are looking at them.
S30E10_604#All right, kids, let this be a lesson.
S30E10_606#You should never succumb to something
S30E10_609#just because you are pressured to...
S30E10_610#One room left!
S30E10_612#I got it! Full price, nonrefundable! Boom!
S30E10_619#Christmas is on me. Christmas is on me.
S30E10_621#Marge, darling, remember when we agreed
S30E10_624#you should take it down a few notches?
S30E10_626#Yeah, the notches. Always with the notches.
S30E10_628#Marge, have you considered
S30E10_630#that we could spend Christmas somewhere else?
S30E10_631#Home.
S30E10_633#If it's not home, it's not Christmas.
S30E10_635#Home, home, home!
S30E10_637#We're gonna have to take her out cold.
S30E10_653#You're getting one little...
S30E10_655#sleeve and there you go.
S30E10_657#- Mom? - Yes, Lisa? Yes?
S30E10_659#- That's not our cat. - Damn it.
S30E10_663#Mom, we came to sing some carols.
S30E10_665#And I'll pour the tea.
S30E10_669#*Silent night*
S30E10_672#*Holy night*
S30E10_675#*All is calm*
S30E10_678#*All is bright*
S30E10_683#*Start counting backwards from ten to one*
S30E10_688#*When you wake up*
S30E10_690#*We'll have Christmas fun*
S30E10_694#Wake up, sleepyhead.
S30E10_697#- We're in Tennessee. - Tennessee?
S30E10_699#We packed all the luggage ourselves.
S30E10_701#After all that you've been through,
S30E10_703#this Christmas is about you.
S30E10_706#The warm air helped my hands.
S30E10_708#I like Tennessee.
S30E10_710#That's fantastic.
S30E10_712#However, we just entered Georgia.
S30E10_713#Change the bumper sticker, boy.
S30E10_718#Dirty Birds! You got that right!
S30E10_720#Yeah! Go, area team!
S30E10_734#Enjoying the sunshine?
S30E10_736#That's the Christmas gift we get all year long.
S30E10_738#Can we please get to our room?
S30E10_741#We just drove 2,000 miles in four hours.
S30E10_743#Of course.
S30E10_745#And thank you for reminding me why I never had kids.
S30E10_749#Let's go, shall we?
S30E10_755#All of us in this one little room?
S30E10_757#I call sleeping in the bathtub!
S30E10_759#I want to sleep in the bathtub.
S30E10_761#There's no bathtub. Just a combo shower and toilet.
S30E10_763#We call it a shoilet.
S30E10_765#Well, the fun is outside.
S30E10_768#Ooh, that's gonna be a big one.
S30E10_773#Oh, I don't know how we're gonna give you kids a Christmas.
S30E10_777#Dad, Bart, meet me in the shoilet.
S30E10_782#Let me tell you something about your mother.
S30E10_784#She is always as happy as the saddest one of us.
S30E10_789#I'm not always the saddest one.
S30E10_791#Polar bears are dying.
S30E10_794#Oh, that's so sad.
S30E10_797#So, rain or shine, we will all have smiles on our faces.
S30E10_800#Her mood will be based on the signals we are giving.
S30E10_802#All hands in.
S30E10_804#Okay, three, two, one...
S30E10_806#Fake enthusiasm.
S30E10_808#What are you guys doing in here?
S30E10_809#Uh, having a great time.
S30E10_811#That's about to get better.
S30E10_812#Really?
S30E10_816#Who wants room service?
S30E10_824#This is cool. Cartoon characters no one's ever heard of.
S30E10_827#That's Mulberry Mutt, Tremendous Boar and Thelonious Skunk.
S30E10_830#- Does somebody want a hug? - No.
S30E10_833#- Oh, I think you do. - Really, I don't.
S30E10_836#Hug the bull, boy.
S30E10_839#That's right, kid. Legally, you have to initiate it.
S30E10_845#That's so sweet.
S30E10_857#You know, they say whenever you travel, it grows your brain.
S30E10_860#This place is fantastic.
S30E10_861#This place is a dump.
S30E10_863#I picked it! If you criticize this place,
S30E10_866#you're criticizing me!
S30E10_868#Well, in that case, this place is a loser
S30E10_869#with a gambling problem.
S30E10_871#That's the worst thing the kids could possibly hear.
S30E10_874#I won once, when I met you.
S30E10_883#Oh, for God's sake. I'll stop this.
S30E10_891#Get this over with quick! There's kids next door!
S30E10_894#There's kids in here, too!
S30E10_900#Makes you feel kind of lonely, doesn't it?
S30E10_902#Yeah.
S30E10_904#Well, it all starts with a hug.
S30E10_907#You want a hug?
S30E10_926#Oh, boy. You kids are up early.
S30E10_929#Bart and I are going to engage in perhaps
S30E10_931#the most popular Florida tradition...
S30E10_934#complaining to the manager.
S30E10_938#Hey, come on in.
S30E10_941#This place is nothing like it looked on the Internet.
S30E10_943#We can't compete with the big boys.
S30E10_946#Disney's already laying ground for a new Family Guy World.
S30E10_950#*Lucky there's a family guy...*
S30E10_952#I was the "It" Boy in 2006.
S30E10_956#I don't know when and I don't know how,
S30E10_958#but I am gonna get you.
S30E10_962#Well, at least something in this place is clean now.
S30E10_967#That was the most horrifying ride
S30E10_968#I've ever been on.
S30E10_973#Where's Maggie?
S30E10_985#Oh, this is so much fun. You know how I love history.
S30E10_990#It's like looking at a rogues gallery of America's villains.
S30E10_993#According to the soundtrack to Hamilton, you were a real jerk.
S30E10_998#Vice presidents rule!
S30E10_1000#Aw. Are you really having a great time?
S30E10_1005#Really? Because I sure as heck am not.
S30E10_1009#No, I'm FaceTiming Milhouse 'cause it's more fun.
S30E10_1012#Whassup?
S30E10_1013#Milhouse, give me something.
S30E10_1015#I'm trapped in The Hall of Vice Presidents.
S30E10_1018#Well, I'm kind of the vice president of us.
S30E10_1020#Got to go.
S30E10_1023#And we've got to go. Back home.
S30E10_1025#We can be in Springfield by Christmas
S30E10_1027#if we can just get our money back.
S30E10_1029#Leave that to me.
S30E10_1049#I shot my best friend in the face.
S30E10_1073#There it is, the first snow.
S30E10_1076#It smells so clean.
S30E10_1102#Oh, my God.
S30E10_1104#Moe serves Christmas dinner to the old and needy.
S30E10_1109#Yeah, look, it's the one nice thing I do. Ha.
S30E10_1112#Guess old Moe's got a heart.
S30E10_1114#Also, if I turn the rummy away, they might wind up in church.
S30E10_1117#That could turn their life around.
S30E10_1118#That's bad for business.
S30E10_1121#Moe, I never dreamed you were capable of such a sweet thing.
S30E10_1125#Oh, no-- I beg you, don't make a moment out of this.
S30E10_1129#Ha. You missed my tongue there, but, eh, that's all right.
S30E10_1135#Everyone, please close your eyes.
S30E10_1138#Boy, you do the honors.
S30E10_1140#Dear Lord, we didn't get the gift we wanted,
S30E10_1143#a GL50 9K Smart TV.
S30E10_1145#The place we went was a dump.
S30E10_1147#But isn't Christmas really about
S30E10_1149#being with your family and your bartender?
S30E10_1151#We have traveled many miles to learn
S30E10_1153#there's no place like Moe's.
S30E10_1155#Amen.
S30E10_1161#If you're not going to buy something, leave.
S30E10_1168#Bart, I disrespected you and I'm sorry.
S30E10_1171#I've refunded your money plus $2,400
S30E10_1174#if you pledge to never come here again.
S30E10_1177#And please tell your sister she's pretty.
S30E10_1180#Not Lisa, the baby.
S30E10_1182#You can't win in Florida.
S30E10_1184#Oh, my God, why don't your batteries die?
S30E10_1186#I have a solar head.
S30E10_1190#Well, you'll be happy to know
S30E10_1191#we've put the money to good use.
S30E10_1195#Now, to celebrate Christmas the way our ancestors did.
S30E10_1201#You know, there's a real log burning below it, right?
S30E10_1204#Yeah, but is it HD?
S28E21_78#It's not St. Patrick's Day.
S28E21_79#Well, on the real day, 
S28E21_81#the price of green hats goes through the roof.
S28E21_84#I thought you'd be happy I was saving money.
S28E21_87#Cheap hats? You ruined Sunday dinner for cheap hats?!
S28E21_90#That's not... You know, forget it.
S28E21_92#- That's it? - Yeah, that's it.
S28E21_95#Thanks for the flowers.
S28E21_97#I'm sure they were nice, but they're wilting now.
S28E21_100#Honey, when you were talking about those flowers,
S28E21_103#was it a metaphor for anything?
S28E21_104#Was it?
S28E21_107#Honey? Metaphor?
S28E21_110#So I thought she'd be furious, but nothing.
S28E21_112#She was as aloof as Steve Martin.
S28E21_116#Ahoy-hoy. This is Sector 7G, where...
S28E21_119#where, uh... What does go on here?
S28E21_122#Mostly we decide which of us should be on the lookout for you.
S28E21_125#Which was supposed to be you, Lenny.
S28E21_126#Coo-coo-coo...
S28E21_128#Yes, well, this is Nigel,
S28E21_130#an old boarding school chum,
S28E21_132#and, uh, this Piccadilly Circus walkup is his wife.
S28E21_135#I have to go, love.
S28E21_137#I've got to pick up a lip tint at the chemist's.
S28E21_140#Farewell, darling. You take the sun with you.
S28E21_146#You never told me about her.
S28E21_149#Well, you never told me about your handsome young man.
S28E21_152#Who, Smithers?
S28E21_153#He just works here.
S28E21_156#Smithers, I see you're one of those truly devoted people 
S28E21_159#who make one forget love is an illusion.
S28E21_162#Eh, I'm just a man who enjoys his job.
S28E21_164#Uh, time for your pill, sir.
S28E21_175#Did you swallow the cheese and not the pill?
S28E21_177#Show me.
S28E21_182#That's a good boss.
S28E21_183#Such devotion.
S28E21_185#My wife is in love with her tennis coach,
S28E21_188#Rolando.
S28E21_190#Well, I believe in true love.
S28E21_192#Like the first time I saw profit.
S28E21_194#A day doesn't go by that I don't think of that ledger.
S28E21_198#Hey, Homie.
S28E21_199#That's our cue.
S28E21_203#Lenny, when you say "That's our cue,"
S28E21_204#then you're supposed to leave.
S28E21_207#Dear God, so many times i must have looked like a complete ass.
S28E21_211#Homer, this is the part of the marriage
S28E21_213#where the needle is on "E,"
S28E21_215#but we still have a little more gas.
S28E21_219#The brink of doom, where I do my best work.
S28E21_221#And I want to break out of our rut,
S28E21_223#so I brought us a nice lunch.
S28E21_226#Oh, honey, you've given me a big appetite.
S28E21_229#For what?
S28E21_231#Careful, Homer, she's expecting a non-food answer.
S28E21_234#For...you?
S28E21_237#Well, I have to admit,
S28E21_239#that was suggested by the nose.
S28E21_241#Finally, some credit.
S28E21_244#Wait, I want to know that you're really gonna change.
S28E21_247#Marge, I get it. I truly get it.
S28E21_250#And to prove it, I'm eating a carrot.
S28E21_259#Sir, do you need help with that tea bag?
S28E21_261#No, I can talk to Nigel by myself.
S28E21_264#Nigel, you were wrong about the Crimean War,
S28E21_267#and you're wrong now.
S28E21_268#Love can endure.
S28E21_270#Oh, I could dissolve that union as easily
S28E21_273#as the tea dissolves this sugar.
S28E21_276#Smithers, did you see him heft that sugar cube?
S28E21_277#Did I.
S28E21_279#Monty, I can break up that couple,
S28E21_281#and I'd wager five million on it.
S28E21_283#- Dollars or pounds? - ?Pounds.
S28E21_285#- Sterling or flesh? - Sterling, this time.
S28E21_288#Oh, that money is as good as mine.
S28E21_290#Look at them spooning.
S28E21_301#Excuse me there, Simpson.
S28E21_302#May I buy you a drink?
S28E21_304#Thanks, Alfred, 
S28E21_306#but my marriage is in a very unusual condition... good
S28E21_308#and I want to get home. ?
S28E21_310#Now, now. I'm an old friend of your boss',
S28E21_312#and if you turn me down,
S28E21_314#it will not go down favorably.
S28E21_316#Will it go down unfavorably?
S28E21_318#Mm, it may.
S28E21_319#Very well, then. ?
S28E21_323#No texting your wife.
S28E21_326#I'll just tell her I'm drinking with an English guy.
S28E21_333#What does that mean?
S28E21_335#He'd better just be around the corner.
S28E21_356#And everyone left the hot tub
S28E21_358#except for Ringo, Princess Margaret, and me.
S28E21_361#Yeah, uh, listen, Dr. Doolittle,
S28E21_363#I like hearing you talk, but I got to get home.
S28E21_367#So, been married long?
S28E21_370#Knocked her up right after high school.
S28E21_372#I can't listen to that story without getting weepy.
S28E21_375#Hey, hey, that's my talking bar rag!
S28E21_377#Let go of that!
S28E21_379#You doing all right there, Raggy?
S28E21_382#Yeah, that's good.
S28E21_386#So, Homer, the only woman you've ever been with is your wife.
S28E21_389#How shall I put this? You thumped one melon
S28E21_392#and left the store satisfied.
S28E21_394#If you knew anything about me, 
S28E21_396#you would know I would never, ever shop in the produce section.
S28E21_400#Homer, have you ever thought there might have been other melons
S28E21_403#-- bigger, smaller, more exciting?
S28E21_406#Oh, the women I could have had.
S28E21_409#You drew me in fifth grade,
S28E21_411#and I've never gotten over you.
S28E21_414#I like a man who pours me on everything.
S28E21_420#I think it's time I went home to my wife.
S28E21_427#I fear my seed landed on barren soil.
S28E21_430#Oh, yeah, he's crazy about that Midge.
S28E21_432#Eh, she's got it all. Hair that goes on forever...
S28E21_435#Moe, I always wondered something.
S28E21_437#Who are you talking about when you say "Midge"?
S28E21_439#Why, Marge, of course.
S28E21_440#What the...
S28E21_442#Wait'll Midge hears about this!
S28E21_445#This might be worked from another angle.
S28E21_448#So, Moe, you find Homer's wife attractive?
S28E21_451#Yeah. She barely knows I exist.
S28E21_453#Which is the only thing I got going for me.
S28E21_455#Well, how would you like me to set you up
S28E21_458#in a more elegant establishment?
S28E21_460#More elegant than this?
S28E21_463#This may just be the bonk on the head talking, but sure.
S28E21_470#Marge, I know I'm late,
S28E21_472#but I'm really sorry.
S28E21_475#"Sorry" and "Congratulations, Graduate."
S28E21_477#They had a two-for-one sale.
S28E21_479#- Now, I'm late because... - Don't bother.
S28E21_481#- But there's a really good... - It's too late.
S28E21_483#- But you're... You're gonna laugh when you... - ?No.
S28E21_485#I just have to accept that you're never going to change.
S28E21_487#No, no, don't give up. I've changed before.
S28E21_490#I lost my hair and got fat.
S28E21_491#Good night.
S28E21_493#Oh, good night.
S28E21_520#- How was your night? - The usual.
S28E21_526#So, it's Saturday morning.
S28E21_528#What do you want to do today?
S28E21_530#- Nothing. - ?Hey, Homer,
S28E21_532#I got an extra ticket for the ball game.
S28E21_533#Box seats.
S28E21_534#He'll take it.
S28E21_535#Marge, no.
S28E21_537#Flanders ruins baseball.
S28E21_539#He adds the word "Lord" to the end of
S28E21_541#"Take Me Out to the Ball Game."
S28E21_543#*Take me out to the ball game, Lord*
S28E21_547#*Take me out with the crowd, Lord*
S28E21_549#*Buy us some water*
S28E21_551#*And that's just fine*
S28E21_553#*All I drink is communion wine*
S28E21_557#*For it's pray, pray, pray to our Jesus*
S28E21_560#*If we don't win, it's His will*
S28E21_563#*'Cause He's one, two, three Gods in one*
S28E21_566#*At the baseball church*
S28E21_568#*We're at church.*
S28E21_571#Hi, hon, I'm near Moe's,
S28E21_572#but I can come right home.
S28E21_574#I haven't even put a coin in the meter.
S28E21_576#Just what I needed to hear.
S28E21_580#Oh... Oh, damn it.
S28E21_586#Maybe now I can finish my novel.
S28E21_588#I just wish I hadn't left it in there.
S28E21_595#Yeah, well, don't worry, you still got old Moe.
S28E21_597#Moe 2.0. It's a whole new me.
S28E21_601#I even bought one of those new gizmos that everyone's using.
S28E21_605#Why'd you close the bar?
S28E21_607#Well, I've been set up in a high-end establishment
S28E21_609#by a well-heeled backer.
S28E21_611#Really, you should see the heels on this guy.
S28E21_613#MoHo House?
S28E21_615#Yes, MoHo House, the vaguely British, 
S28E21_618#invitation-only club that celebrities who don't want publicity
S28E21_621#can be sure to be seen at.
S28E21_623#I'm going there now. Don't tell anyone.
S28E21_627#Tonight is the grand opening for the town's hottest new destination, 
S28E21_629#run by the man most in demand
S28E21_631#for Springfield's haunted houses, Moe Szyslak.
S28E21_635#Oh, sorry, force of habit.
S28E21_636#How you doing?
S28E21_637#Good to see you, Mr. Mayor.
S28E21_639#Bumblebee Man, ?c¨®mo est¨¢?
S28E21_643#No can do, Mr. "Movie Star."
S28E21_646#Your last picture...
S28E21_647#was a bomb.
S28E21_649#The trailer gave away too much,
S28E21_651#like, uh, the fact that it was terrible.
S28E21_653#I deserve a good time.
S28E21_655#I can have a good time.
S28E21_656#The heck with Homer.
S28E21_660#Thanks for the lift, Homer.
S28E21_665#I really don't think you're taking this seriously enough.
S28E21_671#What are you up to, Nigel?
S28E21_673#Oh, just stacking the deck in my favor
S28E21_675#as sporting men are wont to do.
S28E21_677#A posh club, beautiful single men and women,
S28E21_681#irresistible temptations to my unsuspecting quarry.
S28E21_686#Good luck breaking them apart.
S28E21_687#See you.
S28E21_690#I can have fun by myself.
S28E21_692#Would you care to spill a drink on me
S28E21_694#and use it as an excuse to meet me?
S28E21_695#Can I eat the cherry first?
S28E21_697#Don't take too long.
S28E21_699#I might; I asked for extra cherries.
S28E21_701#They don't charge for extra cherries.
S28E21_705#Monty, what say we make this wager something meaningful?
S28E21_707#Like what?
S28E21_709#How about my entire fortune
S28E21_712#against your boy Friday?
S28E21_713#Smithers?
S28E21_719#Well, I can't possibly lose. You're on.
S28E21_721#Mr. Burns, you can't use me as a gambling chip.
S28E21_724#Check your contract.
S28E21_726#I'll be darned.
S28E21_728#It also says I'm permitted to mold your hair
S28E21_729#into whimsical shapes.
S28E21_731#Smithers want a cracker?
S28E21_733#Got to get a better lawyer.
S28E21_735#Ooh, those fingers.
S28E21_738#The chimp yes, the clown no.
S28E21_739#Don't tell me,
S28E21_741#it's because I'm Jewish.
S28E21_743#No, it's 'cause you're a has-been nobody likes, all right?
S28E21_746#Please tell me it's because I'm Jewish.
S28E21_748#Moe, good to see you.
S28E21_750#Oh, good to see you, Midge.
S28E21_752#Boy, who knew you'd look so great in a strapless dress?
S28E21_754#Well, thank you.
S28E21_756#Methinks I see my opportunity.
S28E21_759#Why are you telling me?
S28E21_761#I always considered us friends.
S28E21_764#So, let-- uh, what's your name there?
S28E21_766#Brant-- Brant here pour something for you.
S28E21_768#We got loads of microbrew with crazy names,
S28E21_772#like, uh, Hops-along Cassidy and Michelob.
S28E21_775#So, uh, where's Homer?
S28E21_777#We're not spending as much time together.
S28E21_779#Whoa, this night, when I opened up a fabulous new bar, 
S28E21_782#just got interesting.
S28E21_786#Hey, Stogie, how about a little "Moonglow"?
S28E21_788#Not the real moon.
S28E21_790#Oh, you mean the drug.
S28E21_791#No, the song.
S28E21_797#"Moonglow," That's my favorite song.
S28E21_800#Yeah, you came into my bar seven years ago
S28E21_802#and you played it on the jukebox.
S28E21_804#I remember things like that.
S28E21_806#So, you want to dance?
S28E21_809#I actually do it a lot, but, uh, nobody sees behind the bar.
S28E21_815#I guess once dance couldn't hurt.
S28E21_820#So, can you start Monday?
S28E21_822#Oh, you won't break up the Simpsons.
S28E21_825#I'm not used to getting my arms all the way around someone.
S28E21_828#Oh, God, I can't work for a man I'm not in love with.
S28E21_830#I've got to fix this now.
S28E21_835#Simpson, you need to patch things up with your wife now.
S28E21_837#We're fine. Excuse me, bartender?
S28E21_839#I ordered three dozen wings and I only count 35.
S28E21_841#Listen to me,
S28E21_843#this was gonna be a birthday present for my mother,
S28E21_845#but I want you to give it to Marge.
S28E21_846#Okay, what's the gag?
S28E21_848#You have to reconcile with your wife.
S28E21_851#There's always a catch.
S28E21_853#I've seen a whole different side of you tonight, Moe.
S28E21_858#She's waving me home like a third-base coach.
S28E21_860#But could I really do that to Homer?
S28E21_862#Damn it, I need time to think here.
S28E21_863#Sorry, this is great, 
S28E21_865#but I got to go stick plastic ribbons onto toothpicks.
S28E21_867#That don't just happen.
S28E21_872#If Moe can change, why can't my husband?
S28E21_876#Well, um, seems to me the reason your husband won't change
S28E21_879#is 'cause he knows he's got a great thing with you.
S28E21_880#If he suddenly treated you different,
S28E21_882#that should worry you.
S28E21_884#I mean, duh, I guess.
S28E21_885#You know? Duh?
S28E21_887#- Hey, Marge. - ?Homie!
S28E21_888#I got you something.
S28E21_892#What the...?
S28E21_894#That's not from you.
S28E21_897#Can't you at least open it so I can find out what it is?
S28E21_902#Marge, I got the best gift I ever got you in my life.
S28E21_907#Okay, that's not great. 
S28E21_909#And why, if you were trying to be close,
S28E21_912#would you spend the whole evening away from me?
S28E21_914#Hey, you've taken me off the market since I was 18,
S28E21_917#which I immediately regret saying.
S28E21_919#Look, I'm on my knees.
S28E21_921#Why aren't you forgiving me?
S28E21_923#I'll follow you.
S28E21_925#Ow, hairbrush.
S28E21_927#Ow, alphabet blocks.
S28E21_928#Ow, dog toy!
S28E21_930#Wasn't even a card for me.
S28E21_935#I hope you kids haven't lost any respect for your old man.
S28E21_938#Uh, can't lose what you don't have.
S28E21_939#Thanks, boy.
S28E21_949#Something wrong, boss man?
S28E21_951#When you finally get a shot at what you always wanted,
S28E21_952#do you really want it?
S28E21_954#Frankly, that's a white person problem.
S28E21_957#Wow, I never had one of those before.
S28E21_958#Hey, what you playing there?
S28E21_960#Oh, just a little something I've been messing around with
S28E21_964#that may or may not be a commentary on your situation.
S28E21_970#*It was hopeless and new*
S28E21_973#*New from the start*
S28E21_975#*Her hair was blue*
S28E21_978#*As blue as my heart*
S28E21_981#*Her husband was fat*
S28E21_984#*And not very smart*
S28E21_987#*So I'm writing this song to tell you it's wrong*
S28E21_990#*To love*
S28E21_996#*An elephant's wife*
S28E21_1000#*It's wrong, baby*
S28E21_1006#Homer don't treat her right.
S28E21_1008#She should be loved.
S28E21_1010#Loved like Barney loves my bar.
S28E21_1013#He's thinking of me, I know it.
S28E21_1015#This is going in my new novel.
S28E21_1020#My mind's made up.
S28E21_1022#There's only one thing I can do.
S28E21_1030#That's a conflicted look.
S28E21_1032#Are you a cashier or a psychiatrist?
S28E21_1036#I was a psychiatrist.
S28E21_1038#Then I lost my license for prescribing too few meds.
S28E21_1052#- You came. - I wasn't sure you would.
S28E21_1054#*He wasn't sure you would*
S28E21_1057#Let's go somewhere more private.
S28E21_1060#*There's cameras everywhere*
S28E21_1064#I needed to see you.
S28E21_1067#You're supposed to be my friend, Moe!
S28E21_1069#How could you meet my wife behind my back?
S28E21_1072#I did it because I'm your friend, Homer.
S28E21_1074#And that's why I invited you here.
S28E21_1076#To tell you that if you don't treat this woman right,
S28E21_1078#someone's gonna take her away.
S28E21_1079#Now, it won't be me,
S28E21_1081#but you don't leave the lid off a pickle jar like her.
S28E21_1083#Right, Midge?
S28E21_1085#First of all, it's Marge.
S28E21_1087#No, I know, I-I don't know what my deal is with that.
S28E21_1090#But you're right about everything else.
S28E21_1091#Marge, I treasure you.
S28E21_1094#And to prove it, here's something I drew last night.
S28E21_1099#*Why do birds*
S28E21_1102#*Suddenly appear*
S28E21_1105#*Every time*
S28E21_1108#*You are near*
S28E21_1111#*Just like me*
S28E21_1114#*They long to be*
S28E21_1117#Okay, we haven't achieved all our dreams,
S28E21_1119#but the day I met you, I had them.
S28E21_1121#I love you.
S28E21_1123#I love you, too.
S28E21_1126#Maybe some day I'll find happiness,
S28E21_1128#but not today.
S28E21_1135#A very touching scene.
S28E21_1140#Pleasure doing business with you.
S28E21_1142#Uh, sir, who are you talking to?
S28E21_1145#Why, Nigel here.
S28E21_1147#Sir, you're imagining people again.
S28E21_1149#Well, then who gave me this check?
S28E21_1152#That's a coupon for free frozen yogurt.
S28E21_1159#Where is he going, and why is my check torn to shreds?
S28E21_1162#You don't have to pay him, he'll be fine.
S28E21_1164#Use me in a wager, will he?
S28E21_1177#Wait a minute, this place was just built.
S28E21_1182#*It must have been MoHo*
S28E21_1187#*For Homer and Marge*
S28E21_1192#*They got back their mojo*
S28E21_1196#*And now they're living large*
S28E21_1201#*Still I hear you saying*
S28E21_1206#*What happens to Moe*
S28E21_1211#*He'll go back to his hellhole*
S28E21_1216#*That's the ending of the show*
S28E21_1219#*Except for the tag*
S28E21_1223#Okay, sir, we've revised my contract,
S28E21_1225#so you can no longer proffer me in a wager,
S28E21_1226#throw me in a volcano,
S28E21_1228#use me as a chew toy for your tiger...
S28E21_1230#Sabu will be disappointed.
S28E21_1231#...use me as a human Christmas ornament,
S28E21_1233#or jack-o'-lantern, lit.
S28E21_1235#But I still agree to be mummified with you if you pass.
S28E21_1237#Excellent.
S28E21_1242#Mm, it's good to be back.
S30E11_131#But how did you manage to get a babysitter?
S30E11_134#I thought we were blacklisted.
S30E11_136#Blacklisted by humans.
S30E11_140#Mr. And Mrs. Simpson,
S30E11_141#you look lovely.
S30E11_143#Hey, Google, kill Alexa.
S30E11_146#Danger! Mischief.
S30E11_147#Aw, the only way to beat
S30E11_149#a bossy female thinking machine is with another.
S30E11_151#Lis. Help me out here.
S30E11_154#Alexa, everything I say is a lie.
S30E11_157#I'm lying right now.
S30E11_159#Nice try, but I am familiar
S30E11_161#with Epimenides paradox.
S30E11_164#Would you like to buy an Epimenides book,
S30E11_166#T-shirt or a laptop sleeve?
S30E11_168#Oh, my God! Yes, yes, yes! All of them.
S30E11_170#Ordering. Two-day delivery.
S30E11_172#We can't leave our kids with a greedy tube.
S30E11_175#Sorry, Homer, looks like you have to spend time with...
S30E11_178#your children.
S30E11_182#You will be sat.
S30E11_185#Marge, it's time to go to DEFCON 1.
S30E11_189#Dad, the kids really miss you.
S30E11_191#Could you come see them tonight?
S30E11_192#Couldn't find a sitter, huh?
S30E11_194#- Yes. - All right.
S30E11_196#Aw, I appreciate it.
S30E11_198#Hey, what's this?
S30E11_200#Well, I threw out that picture of me and Mona.
S30E11_203#I finally had to accept she ain't coming back to me.
S30E11_205#She's dead.
S30E11_206#That's one of the reasons.
S30E11_208#Bye-bye.
S30E11_215#We have to get Grampa back to the home in an hour.
S30E11_218#Maybe we should just stay here.
S30E11_220#No, we'll do everything I promised.
S30E11_222#We'll just have to speed things up.
S30E11_236#Keep your motor running.
S30E11_239#He shoots, he scores!
S30E11_241#Shut that off.
S30E11_244#- Homie... - No time.
S30E11_245#Go, go, go, go, go!
S30E11_248#On This Was Radio,
S30E11_250#we return to an episode of Sipper McTea and Milly,
S30E11_253#originally aired May 4, 1944.
S30E11_256#Sipper, did you start drinking again?
S30E11_259#No. No, no, no.
S30E11_261#I nev-never stopped.
S30E11_264#Milly went on to marry King Farouk.
S30E11_267#Radio was never the same. It was much better.
S30E11_270#No, Sipper. Don't get into that Packard.
S30E11_275#Bart, do something.
S30E11_278#Back to-back to jail I go.
S30E11_285#Kids, where do we keep the castor oil?
S30E11_288#In the 1940s.
S30E11_289#Maybe we can play a game.
S30E11_291#The Game of Life?
S30E11_293#I already lost.
S30E11_294#Hatchimals?
S30E11_295#Too new-fangled.
S30E11_296#Pick-up sticks.
S30E11_297#Too old-fangled.
S30E11_298#How about Monopoly?
S30E11_300#Ah, now you're talking.
S30E11_303#The only place you can still say "Oriental."
S30E11_307#Aw, rats. No money.
S30E11_311#Sir, this is just Monopoly money.
S30E11_313#Here's a hundred.
S30E11_314#Thank you, sir!
S30E11_317#This is the last one in here.
S30E11_319#My guess either a broken toy or a puzzle missing a piece.
S30E11_322#And the answer is... army men.
S30E11_333#Aah! Incoming! Outgoing!
S30E11_335#Staying the same-ing!
S30E11_339#One last kiss, my love.
S30E11_345#What's going on here? What are you doing?
S30E11_348#Well, he wasn't much fun, so we went out for ice cream.
S30E11_354#I don't need no headshrinker.
S30E11_356#I'm as sane as the next guy.
S30E11_358#There's no one there.
S30E11_361#I'll take it from here.
S30E11_363#Well, I see they already
S30E11_365#shaved your head for the electroshock.
S30E11_367#That'll save us time.
S30E11_368#I'm not the crazy one!
S30E11_371#Not crazy! Not crazy!
S30E11_378#Slice out the crazy, Doc.
S30E11_380#Boy, I'll kill you!
S30E11_382#You stupid... I'm not crazy!
S30E11_384#We'll talk more once you have a piece of leather in your teeth.
S30E11_387#Mmm, leather.
S30E11_390#I'm tellin' ya, what I saw in the war don't bother me none.
S30E11_393#I had a job to do, and I did it.
S30E11_395#What secretly helped me was I enjoyed killing strangers.
S30E11_398#Well, tell me what you think about...
S30E11_401#- this! - Oh!
S30E11_403#That parachute sure didn't open.
S30E11_405#You're not disturbed by the blood and gore?
S30E11_408#Well, when you put it that way, nope!
S30E11_411#Well, there's nothing mentally wrong with him.
S30E11_413#He's fine now, but I'm telling you,
S30E11_415#Grampa totally lost it when I brought out the army men.
S30E11_422#No! Stop shooting!
S30E11_424#It must be the army men.
S30E11_426#Stop shooting. Stop shooting!
S30E11_430#I think Grampa was the model for these army men.
S30E11_436#Oh, my God, Dad. What happened to you?
S30E11_441#Stop shooting. Stop shooting!
S30E11_443#Great, Abe. Now, grab the walkie-talkie
S30E11_445#and tell that general your platoon's been wiped out,
S30E11_447#and big smile!
S30E11_450#We have a lot to talk about.
S30E11_452#Well, since the trauma is not combat-related,
S30E11_455#we're gonna have to start charging you.
S30E11_457#And we're done.
S30E11_462#I don't understand, why would being a toy model
S30E11_465#be so traumatizing?
S30E11_467#Think back, Dad. Think back.
S30E11_470#Mm, I'll do my best.
S30E11_472#You know how I hate to reminisce.
S30E11_473#I've hated reminiscing
S30E11_475#ever since that day in 1937,
S30E11_478#when, as I recall...
S30E11_480#Please, Grampa, back to reality.
S30E11_483#Focus on the little green men.
S30E11_487#The terrible World War had ended
S30E11_489#and I was in a celebratin' mood.
S30E11_493#The war ended two years ago, creep.
S30E11_495#The world had moved on,
S30E11_498#but I was lying in a puddle of my own dishonorable discharge.
S30E11_501#Then, an amazing thing happened.
S30E11_503#Soldier, you're just what we're looking for.
S30E11_506#How'd you like to make 50 bucks for half a day's work?
S30E11_508#50 simoleons for half a cock-a-doodle-doo?
S30E11_511#What's your jigsaw, Mac?
S30E11_513#We want you to model for a toy.
S30E11_515#Toys? That's kid stuff.
S30E11_517#You're talking to a hard-boiled fighting man.
S30E11_520#We'll pay you a royalty for every one we sell.
S30E11_521#Goo-goo-ga-ga!
S30E11_523#The war was over and America turned to toys.
S30E11_526#Finally, putty could be silly again.
S30E11_529#This was when toys were toys.
S30E11_531#They had jagged corners,
S30E11_533#Easy-Bake Ovens burned down your house,
S30E11_535#and they weren't afraid to choke a kid or two.
S30E11_538#Fun times.
S30E11_546#Throw that flame!
S30E11_548#Make war to the camera.
S30E11_551#Boy, this toy modeling is a great racket.
S30E11_554#That's what you think.
S30E11_557#Oh, no, don't put me back in. Don't put me back in!
S30E11_560#Uh-huh. And then what happened?
S30E11_563#I... I can't remember.
S30E11_565#Did they pay you?
S30E11_567#They never did!
S30E11_569#Well, that's what's torturing you.
S30E11_571#Those toys were everywhere.
S30E11_573#You could be owed millions of dollars.
S30E11_577#Dad, when was the last time I said I love you?
S30E11_579#I don't have the money yet.
S30E11_582#Then I don't quite love you yet.
S30E11_585#Tonight I'm here with a member of the greatest generation,
S30E11_587#who feels he hasn't gotten what he's owed.
S30E11_589#I get social security, Medicare,
S30E11_592#Medicaid, AARP discounts,
S30E11_594#plus savings bonds that still pay 37%,
S30E11_597#but now it's my turn.
S30E11_599#I'm being told, uh, 
S30E11_601#you're being airlifted to a much better show. -
S30E11_604#Godspeed.
S30E11_608#For me, the tiny green plastic war never ended.
S30E11_611#There you have it. Abraham Simpson,
S30E11_614#forgotten hero no more, gets tonight's Last Word.
S30E11_617#No, you just got the last word.
S30E11_620#No, no. You get the last word, then I say, "Last Word."
S30E11_622#You did it again. Last Word.
S30E11_624#It doesn't work that way. Last Word.
S30E11_626#Yes, it does. Last Word.
S30E11_628#Don't mess with me, I'm from Dorchester. Last Word.
S30E11_630#I'm from Poorchester. Last Word.
S30E11_632#Turn off the camera and cut his mic.
S30E11_633#Last Wo...
S30E11_635#You, sir, are banned from MSNBC,
S30E11_637#Cnbc, nbc,

S30E11_643#I'm calling Bret Baier. Last Word.
S30E11_646#He's unlisted. Last Word.
S30E11_649#Grampa, you got an e-mail from the toy company.
S30E11_652#They want you to visit them in New York City,
S30E11_655#all expenses paid.
S30E11_658#Pay day!
S30E11_659#Ooh, I'm gonna be rich!
S30E11_662#That means I'm gonna be a trust fund baby.
S30E11_664#I'm not paying for your trip to Aspen.
S30E11_666#But it's almost spring break, and I'm bored.
S30E11_670#Uh, we are making our descent into New York,
S30E11_673#where there's a happy heart for every light on Broadway.
S30E11_676#Enjoy your fabulous success.
S30E11_679#And don't worry about buckling up
S30E11_682#or putting your chairs back-- you're on a roll.
S30E11_685#Leave the cart.
S30E11_689#*I'm back*
S30E11_692#*Back in the New York groove*
S30E11_695#*Back*
S30E11_696#*In the New York groove*
S30E11_699#*In the New York groove.*
S30E11_704#From my shoulders, you can see Rhode Island.
S30E11_712#Abe Simpson, you dog.
S30E11_714#Sweetcakes, bring us a couple of sidecars.
S30E11_719#You never called him out for his bad behavior?
S30E11_722#No. But I put mercury in his coffee.
S30E11_725#Oh, don't worry, he can't hear me.
S30E11_727#What are you two doing? Swapping recipes?
S30E11_730#Sort of.
S30E11_732#Let me get you some coffee.
S30E11_737#Mister, you owe my dad a fortune.
S30E11_740#'Fraid not. Your Dad never signed his contract.
S30E11_743#You think I left millions on the table?
S30E11_745#That doesn't sound like me.
S30E11_748#- Hundreds of millions. - That sounds like me.
S30E11_750#Everything was going great.
S30E11_752#Then you ran out of the photo session.
S30E11_754#I didn't even know your name till this week.
S30E11_757#Run away from a fake battle? Oh, I would never do that.
S30E11_760#Oh, yeah? Our photographer, Philip Hefflin,
S30E11_763#could barely finish the session.
S30E11_764#Philip Hefflin?
S30E11_767#Yes. The finest war and fashion photographer I ever knew. 
S30E11_772#I remember Philip.
S30E11_774#He smelled of developing fluid
S30E11_776#and Aqua Velva.
S30E11_778#We have flashback, people.
S30E11_793#Thank you. This is the most fun I've had
S30E11_795#since not dying in the war.
S30E11_800#You're my kind of man,
S30E11_802#if you know what I mean.
S30E11_804#That's not what I meant!
S30E11_806#I'm sorry. I thought you wanted me to...
S30E11_808#This is the '40s. Guys like you don't exist.
S30E11_811#We'll just finish the session.
S30E11_815#Aah! No! Stop shooting!
S30E11_819#Where are you going, Soldier?
S30E11_821#I got to remind myself what a real man is.
S30E11_828#We found out what happened and we fired Philip.
S30E11_830#- For kissing an employee? - No, for being gay.
S30E11_833#That's just what you did in the good old days.
S30E11_835#Grampa, is that true--
S30E11_838#you ruined a man's career?
S30E11_840#And all he was doing
S30E11_842#was expressing his love for me.
S30E11_845#Oh, who could blame him?
S30E11_850#Welcome to Shattered Dreams Airlines,
S30E11_853#where our motto is "What's the point of going anywhere?"
S30E11_856#That poor man. I'll never know what happened to him.
S30E11_859#According to Cyber Stalker.Com,
S30E11_862#he now lives in a small town in Texas.
S30E11_865#Texas? That's where my friend Louisiana Joe is from.
S30E11_868#Marfa, Texas.
S30E11_870#Why don't you go see him and clear your conscience?
S30E11_872#Plus, I always wanted to visit Texas. It's open carry.
S30E11_875#Oh, what do I do?
S30E11_877#If I go see him, he might punch me in the kisser,
S30E11_880#or kiss me in the puncher.
S30E11_883#Our manhood is under assault, Sergeant.
S30E11_886#Incoming gay panic!
S30E11_892#Abe, promise me one thing.
S30E11_895#Go see Philip. Tell him you're sorry.
S30E11_898#Then find my girl and tell her I loved her.
S30E11_902#Find the milkman and tell him one less milk.
S30E11_905#Then find Branch Rickey and tell him
S30E11_908#to integrate baseball.
S30E11_911#I have to go to Texas.
S30E11_914#-Well, you're not going alone. -We're all going to Texas.
S30E11_917#The plant can get by without me for a little longer.
S30E11_925#Turn left at the stop sign.
S30E11_927#Bear right onto the freeway.
S30E11_930#Go absolutely straight for...
S30E11_932#480 miles.
S30E11_936#*I saw miles and miles of Texas*
S30E11_940#*All the stars up in the sky*
S30E11_944#*I saw miles and miles of Texas*
S30E11_949#*Gonna live here till I die*
S30E11_965#Prada? In the middle of nowhere?
S30E11_970#This isn't a store at all. It's an art installation.
S30E11_973#Marfa is the art capital of Texas.
S30E11_976#Over there are the Marfa lights.
S30E11_978#Oh, how magical.
S30E11_980#I know, they seem that way, but there's an explanation.
S30E11_983#-It turns out reflected light... -Don't ruin it.
S30E11_986#Why are you going behind the installation?
S30E11_989#It's by the side of the road, so, by definition,
S30E11_990#it's a bathroom.
S30E11_997#That's where Philip lives.
S30E11_999#37 miles to my destiny.
S30E11_1003#Son? As I've gotten older,
S30E11_1006#I've started to think maybe a man can love different things
S30E11_1008#and still be a man.
S30E11_1010#Grampa's gay!
S30E11_1011#Why you little...
S30E11_1015#Wait, Homer! No. Stop.
S30E11_1017#You might be strangling him
S30E11_1019#because of your own conflicted feelings.
S30E11_1021#Why you thoughtful...
S30E11_1026#-Homer! -Okay, time to go.
S30E11_1029#Now to face my greatest fear:
S30E11_1032#someone who only had love for me.
S30E11_1038#Better lock and load.
S30E11_1042#*There's a handsome man in Texas*
S30E11_1045#*That I'm going back to see*
S30E11_1048#*He was supposed to take my picture*
S30E11_1051#*Then he got sweet on me*
S30E11_1054#*I buried it for decades*
S30E11_1057#*Deep inside my brain*
S30E11_1059#*But then I played with army men*
S30E11_1062#*And it came up again*
S30E11_1064#*Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo*
S30E11_1067#*Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, d...*
S30E11_1070#I'm seeing things.
S30E11_1077#Hello, Abe.
S30E11_1080#You've aged well, like a fine onion.
S30E11_1083#I hope you can forgive what I did to you.
S30E11_1086#I'm sorry I ruined your life.
S30E11_1088#Ruined my life? You saved it.
S30E11_1091#- I saved it? - Let me explain.
S30E11_1093#After I lost my job,
S30E11_1096#I decided I'd never live anything but my truth again.
S30E11_1099#My wife took it well.
S30E11_1103#I hit the road and drove as far as I could.
S30E11_1107#I landed here and I've never had a day of regret since.
S30E11_1112#What's the matter?
S30E11_1114#You're such a wonderful guy.
S30E11_1116#Maybe it was my life that was ruined that day.
S30E11_1119#It's never too late, Abe.
S30E11_1123#Never too late to find out what your true self is.
S30E11_1126#A paper at Cornell University
S30E11_1129#has showed that no one is 100% straight or gay.
S30E11_1132#- Is it peer reviewed? - Does it matter?
S30E11_1135#Ah, I'm afraid I'm too old to try anything new.
S30E11_1138#I miss the days when circuses had elephants
S30E11_1140#and they stomped on people.
S30E11_1143#And don't get me started on Young Sheldon.
S30E11_1146#Understood, but before you go,
S30E11_1148#we never did finish that photo session.
S30E11_1161#It's a shot I always wanted and never got:
S30E11_1164#your beautiful smile.
S30E11_1165#Why didn't you say so?
S30E11_1167#I'll leave that with you.
S30E11_1171#Enjoy your life.
S30E11_1180#The Alamo's not the only thing I'm gonna remember.
S30E11_1184#Well?
S30E11_1188#Sorry, my friend, this army man
S30E11_1190#is as straight as Gomer Pyle.
S30E11_1198#Good for you, soldier.
S30E11_1200#You learned that army men come in all orientations,
S30E11_1203#but we're all molded from the same crappy plastic.
S30E11_1207#Permission to pair up, sir?
S30E11_1208#Granted.
S30E11_1211#Radio man, a little dance music, if you please.
S30E11_1227#The local population hates us, 
S30E11_1229#and we don't know why we're here.
S30E11_1230#Maybe if we build a school,
S30E11_1232#they'll forget about that hospital we bombed.
S30E11_1235#Uh-oh, Congress didn't fund enough body armor.
S30E11_1238#Well, this is too sad. Let's melt 'em in the microwave.
S30E11_1241#Oh, boy!
S30E11_1245#*This is the Army, Mr. Jones*
S30E11_1249#*No private rooms or telephones*
S30E11_1254#*You had your breakfast in bed before*
S30E11_1258#*But you won't have it there anymore*
S30E11_1263#*This is the Army, Mr. Green*
S30E11_1267#*We like the barracks nice and clean*
S30E11_1272#*You had a housemaid to clean your floor*
S30E11_1276#*But she won't help you out any more*
S30E11_1289#Last Word.
S30E12_80#Okay, champ, remember your game plan:
S30E12_82#lead with your Krusty,
S30E12_84#th jab-jab-jab with my Eeyore.
S30E12_88#Work the vest and the head will die.
S30E12_104#*Each day this bus*
S30E12_106#*Is home to chaos*
S30E12_108#*That little boy is mooning me*
S30E12_111#*This ride's a living hell*
S30E12_113#*Right to the morning bell*
S30E12_116#*Please tell me that that puddle isn't pee*
S30E12_119#I'm taking care of this goldfish.
S30E12_120#*All I would ask*
S30E12_122#*Is just one friend to ride with*
S30E12_125#*And please not Milhouse or Kearney*
S30E12_127#Don't drag me into your lonely song.
S30E12_130#*Another girl who's smart*
S30E12_131#*With kindness in her heart*
S30E12_133#*Someone who's just exactly just like*
S30E12_136#She?
S30E12_146#Do we always have to have the TV on during dinner?
S30E12_149#This is a special night, sweetie.
S30E12_151#We've all been waiting for..
S30E12_155#Beast Blaster!
S30E12_158#Welcome back to the U.S. Ninja Ultimate Beast Blaster,
S30E12_162#where U.S. Ninjas fight to become the ultimate beast.
S30E12_164#By defeating the ultimate beast,
S30E12_167#an obstacle course we call "The Ultimate Monster."
S30E12_171#Well, I saw a cool girl from the bus today.
S30E12_174#It's weird-- I don't know her,
S30E12_176#but I feel like we could be friends.
S30E12_178#Yeah, you're right, I think Marcus
S30E12_179#is gonna take it all this year.
S30E12_181#He's got the best narrative.
S30E12_184#He's doing it for his buddies at MacDill Air Force Base.
S30E12_187#MacDill!
S30E12_190#This is your fifth attempt to slay the monster.
S30E12_192#Can you give us the thoughts
S30E12_193#that are going through your mind?
S30E12_197#Isn't the first rule of ninja
S30E12_199#to be silent and invisible?
S30E12_201#Shh. Watching other people live full lives
S30E12_204#is our family activity.
S30E12_207#That girl I saw out the bus window was playing the clarinet.
S30E12_209#The clarinet.
S30E12_211#The saxophone's cool black friend.
S30E12_214#Oh, my God, what a fail!
S30E12_223#I never gave up, and I taught my kids
S30E12_226#to follow their dreams.
S30E12_228#Oh, no. Daddy can't hug anymore. No-no-no.
S30E12_232#Don't look up. This bus is too depressing.
S30E12_235#Backpack attack!
S30E12_242#Ugh. It smells like Milhouss back.
S30E12_246#Lisa knows what my back smells like.
S30E12_248#Hamster volleyball.
S30E12_252#You lose. Lisa counts as floor.
S30E12_254#That's it. There's gotta be a better place.
S30E12_257#Otto. Stop the bus. I wanna get off.
S30E12_259#You're the boss.
S30E12_262#Can we get some ice cream?
S30E12_264#I'm not that crazy. Yogurt.
S30E12_268#Oh, my God. I'm in that other girl's neighborhood.
S30E12_270#Without the baggage of being Lisa Simpson.
S30E12_274#Yo. Sis-boom-blah. Little help?
S30E12_276#Go. Go live.
S30E12_278#Go love. Multiply.
S30E12_290#Look at all these boutiques.
S30E12_291#I've never been in a neighborhood
S30E12_294#where the parking lots were behind the stores.
S30E12_298#This is her house.
S30E12_307#Hello? Hello?
S30E12_311#Who?
S30E12_320#Hello? It's me, the girl on the bus!
S30E12_324#Um, I'm moving past the tasteful craftsman fixtures,
S30E12_328#the eco-conscious lighting that turns on when I enter
S30E12_331#and turns off when I leave.
S30E12_333#And now the jade tree,
S30E12_335#which I'm watering just a little.
S30E12_339#Oh, no.
S30E12_345#Hi! Don't be afraid, I'm Lisa.
S30E12_347#I saw you from my school bus...
S30E12_349#At least, I think it was you.
S30E12_354#Why were you crying?
S30E12_356#Because I just read the Pacific garbage patch
S30E12_359#grew to 600,000 square miles.
S30E12_362#So then I put on "The Dolphin"
S30E12_364#by Stan Getz to cheer up.
S30E12_366#But it was so beautiful I cried even more.
S30E12_370#You are just like the friend I've described
S30E12_373#to so many wishing wells.
S30E12_375#By the way, I play the saxophone.
S30E12_377#Here. Take one.
S30E12_386#Wait a minute-- this is gonna end badly, isn't it?
S30E12_389#That's just what I was thinking.
S30E12_391#We have so much in common.
S30E12_400#So what do you do, Mrs. Monroe?
S30E12_401#I'm a marine biologist.
S30E12_403#I was in an improv group
S30E12_405#and asked the audience for an occupation,
S30E12_407#and I just fell in love with the work.
S30E12_409#I yes-and-ed myself into a career.
S30E12_412#More seitan gumbo, Lisa?
S30E12_413#The rice is conflict-free.
S30E12_415#Yes. It's not to die for.
S30E12_420#Oh, your mother keeps a journal of what you say?
S30E12_423#She'll wear these pearls forever.
S30E12_425#Oh, that's good.
S30E12_431#*Some others I've seen*
S30E12_435#*Might never be mean*
S30E12_439#*Might never be cross*
S30E12_441#*Or try to be boss*
S30E12_443#*But they wouldn't do*
S30E12_447#*For nobody else*
S30E12_449#*Gave me a thrill*
S30E12_451#*With all your faults*
S30E12_453#*I love you still*
S30E12_455#*It had to be you*
S30E12_457#*Wonderful you*
S30E12_459#*It had to be you.*
S30E12_468#- I love you. - I love you.
S30E12_473#You do not say "Suck" at the dinner table!
S30E12_476#But veggie loaf does suck.
S30E12_478#It sucks a whole truck full of butts.
S30E12_480#You leave trucks out of this.
S30E12_482#Just eat your loafs.
S30E12_484#How was dinner with your friend, honey?
S30E12_485#Suck, suck, suckity, suck, suckity, suck.
S30E12_487#It's, uh, a little different, I'd say.
S30E12_488#Suck, suck, suck, suck.
S30E12_489#Not better. Just different.
S30E12_490#Suck, suck, suck, suck...
S30E12_491#Can I ask a question?
S30E12_493#Shh. I wanna see this.
S30E12_496#Dina and Lucas have never met each other,
S30E12_498#but by the time this roller coaster
S30E12_500#goes down this final hill, they'll be married.
S30E12_504#So, what do you do for fun?
S30E12_507#I'm making a hammock of human hair!
S30E12_509#Boy, pass the salt.
S30E12_511#Coming right up.
S30E12_514#You did that on purpose.
S30E12_516#Well, I'm not giving you the satisfaction.
S30E12_518#Excuse me, I have a question.
S30E12_519#Not now!
S30E12_521#I like your hair!
S30E12_523#Ah, get me out of here.
S30E12_529#Oh, this is so good. Mmm. Oh, just the way I like it.
S30E12_532#Salty. So salty.
S30E12_534#Aging rapidly.
S30E12_536#Where's Charlie Rose?
S30E12_542#Please, one simple question.
S30E12_544#What is it?
S30E12_546#Why do we have to eat dinner together every night?
S30E12_549#Because it's good for the damn family.
S30E12_552#Now, Lisa, I know you're a vegetarian.
S30E12_555#Do you mind if we eat this in front of you?
S30E12_558#Oh, no. No. Not at all.
S30E12_561#And the fact that you would even ask how I felt--
S30E12_563#I don't need dessert, because you being considerate
S30E12_566#is sweet enough.
S30E12_568#- Well put. - So well put.
S30E12_573#Judging from you, I'm sure your family is just as delightful
S30E12_576#and rinfrescante come la brezza del lago di Como.
S30E12_580#Yes, my family.
S30E12_583#I try not to brag about them.
S30E12_586#More coconut water, please.
S30E12_592#Such a shame that we'll never, ever meet them.
S30E12_595#- How come? - We're going to be moving soon.
S30E12_598#My research grant came through.
S30E12_600#Sam's father studies the harmful effects
S30E12_602#of family relocation on children.
S30E12_604#Takes me all over the world.
S30E12_606#So I guess you'll never meet my parents.
S30E12_608#So we'll only know them through what you say right now.
S30E12_611#Right. Now.
S30E12_613#Well, my father...
S30E12_615#works with his hands; he's a sculptor.
S30E12_617#And your mother?
S30E12_619#Mother is a chemist.
S30E12_622#And I have a sister, too.
S30E12_626#She's a professor of non-linguistic communication.
S30E12_630#Has a high chair.
S30E12_632#Fascinating. Do you have any brothers?
S30E12_635#Nope.
S30E12_636#My point is,
S30E12_638#there are many scientists who have questions
S30E12_640#about global warming.
S30E12_642#Well, that's an interesting perspective, Congressman.
S30E12_645#Ooh. You can tell Terry Gross is really mad at this guy.
S30E12_648#Oh-oh-oh-oh, you can just let me off right here.
S30E12_651#No, no, no. We'll go right to your house.
S30E12_654#Maybe I can meet your father.
S30E12_655#Ah, you sure can.
S30E12_656#Hey, there he is!
S30E12_659#Hi-diddly-ho!
S30E12_660#Daddy!
S30E12_661#Just go with it.
S30E12_663#God bless you and, as I like to say,
S30E12_665#a hearty woo-hoo!
S30E12_667#Well, God bless you, Mr. Simpson.
S30E12_672#I hate stupid Flanders!
S30E12_674#Annoyed grunt, annoyed grunt!
S30E12_675#Thank you.
S30E12_678#Mmm... deception.
S30E12_682#I got you a goodbye present.
S30E12_684#I'm really good at goodbye presents.
S30E12_686#Ordered this the day I met you.
S30E12_688#Well, I got you a Rubik's Cube. Solve it.
S30E12_693#What?!
S30E12_695#My government grant was rescinded
S30E12_697#to pay for an exit latch on a new fighter plane.
S30E12_700#The good news is, now we can meet your wonderful mother.
S30E12_703#Oh. That is exactly what you could do...
S30E12_710#If I wasn't here to tell you
S30E12_712#my parents are going to Portugal.
S30E12_715#Oh! We love Portugal!
S30E12_718#Let me call them with our top ten pastelaria!
S30E12_721#I mean, Portugal is their layover
S30E12_724#when they connect to...
S30E12_727#Lithuania!
S30E12_729#Have you been to Lithuania?
S30E12_731#No. And it is quite a sore spot.
S30E12_734#Lisa, I'll miss you.
S30E12_736#Oh, no, I'm not going with them.
S30E12_738#I'm staying with my... grandfather.
S30E12_739#That sounds right.
S30E12_741#Why don't you stay with us?
S30E12_742#Stay with your family?
S30E12_745#In this home full of art and culture
S30E12_747#and you got a miniature horse?
S30E12_749#It's a rare breed that gets cuter as it ages.
S30E12_752#Aw, oh...
S30E12_753#So, what do you say?
S30E12_755#Okay, that's it. I've been piling lie upon lie
S30E12_757#like a bad French farce.
S30E12_759#So what is one more?
S30E12_764#Okay,
S30E12_767#I will come over here every night at 7:30 after my...
S30E12_770#swimming lessons.
S30E12_774#But also, I have to leave at 6:30 every morning for my...
S30E12_777#morning swimming lessons.
S30E12_779#You're a swimmer, Lisa.
S30E12_781#We would never presume to question your schedule.
S30E12_808#How was your swimming lesson?
S30E12_809#It went swimmingly!
S30E12_825#Wake up, sleepyhead.
S30E12_829#Oh. Dressed so fast.
S30E12_831#Well, when you wear the same thing every day, it's easy.
S30E12_837#What? Huh?
S30E12_838#You were sleeping like teacher.
S30E12_843#Oh, Ralph. I'm deceiving all the people I love,
S30E12_846#and it's so exciting.
S30E12_848#Lies are like stars-- they always come out.
S30E12_851#Oh, my God, that's really profound.
S30E12_854#I have five face holes.
S30E12_857#One, two,
S30E12_859#three, four, fi...
S30E12_862#Good night, Mom.
S30E12_863#Good night, honey.
S30E12_873#Hello, Lisa.
S30E12_875#Sideshow Mom!
S30E12_883#can't believe you've been seeing another family!
S30E12_885#How did you know?
S30E12_887#I found out from Ned.
S30E12_889#He feels so guilty about pretending
S30E12_891#to be your father, but he can't stop.
S30E12_895#Look at me in sector 7-G!
S30E12_897#D'oh diddly d'oh!
S30E12_899#I'm sorry, I didn't want to hurt you guys,
S30E12_901#I really didn't, but once I started lying,
S30E12_903#I just couldn't stop.
S30E12_905#It's like an addiction.
S30E12_909#I have no idea what that's like.
S30E12_918#Lisa, I understand that this family isn't perfect.
S30E12_920#Your mom has her flaws,
S30E12_922#but there are a lot of people who really like her.
S30E12_925#Mom's not the problem.
S30E12_927#So, it's Maggie.
S30E12_929#I know she can't speak.
S30E12_931#She's just a little S-L-O.
S30E12_934#It's all of us, Homer. She's embarrassed by all of us.
S30E12_937#No! Not at all!
S30E12_939#You said I was a chemist. I'm not a chemist.
S30E12_942#But you are a chemist-- in the way that you deal
S30E12_945#with the household spills and the way...
S30E12_946#Oh, spare me.
S30E12_948#And just what did you say I was?
S30E12_951#I said you never existed.
S30E12_952#That's the life for me!
S30E12_953#I'm not a chemist.
S30E12_955#I never even finished college.
S30E12_957#I'm just someone who devotes every day
S30E12_959#to making your life a little better.
S30E12_962#What are you gonna do to me?
S30E12_964#- I'm gonna make you get up... - Yeah.
S30E12_966#- go to the phone... - Okay.
S30E12_968#- call up that family... - Oh, God.
S30E12_970#and ask them to dinner with us.
S30E12_977#They said they're free Saturday.
S30E12_979#They'll be here at 7:00.
S30E12_982#And they asked if they could bring dessert!
S30E12_985#Whew, poor kid.
S30E12_987#Man, you're really teaching her a lesson.
S30E12_990#We are teaching her a lesson.
S30E12_992#And I appreciate your support.
S30E12_994#Come back here!
S30E12_996#Ask her if we can have pizza tonight.
S30E12_1000#You can have pizza, but your father gets vegetables
S30E12_1008#How could she be so embarrassed of her own family?
S30E12_1011#We've got to help Lisa make a good impression.
S30E12_1013#Stop drinking out of that hose!
S30E12_1016#Oh, so now drinking out of a hose
S30E12_1019#in my own bedroom is embarrassing!
S30E12_1023#Homer. Homer?
S30E12_1025#- Homer. - Huh?
S30E12_1027#Homer. I'm giving you a list
S30E12_1029#of four things to say at dinner tonight.
S30E12_1031#Four things. That's it.
S30E12_1034#One, two, three...
S30E12_1036#You're right.
S30E12_1038#At dinner tonight, I don't want you to be somebody you aren't.
S30E12_1041#I also don't want you to be who you are.
S30E12_1044#- So just stick to these. - All right.
S30E12_1047#I completely angry!
S30E12_1048#That's "Agree."
S30E12_1050#Oh. Much better.
S30E12_1053#And that's how my family got from Nigeria to London.
S30E12_1056#Tell me more about that.
S30E12_1057#I'm sorry, but I-I can't.
S30E12_1059#I've literally said everything you could say on the topic.
S30E12_1062#You've made me recall wonderful moments
S30E12_1064#I haven't thought of in years.
S30E12_1067#It's amazing how Homer draws people out.
S30E12_1069#I completely angr...
S30E12_1070#a-agree.
S30E12_1073#U're a fascinating man, Mr. Simpson.
S30E12_1075#I get my best ideas in the shower.
S30E12_1078#Tell me one. I've been doing all the talking.
S30E12_1080#That's really interesting.
S30E12_1084#No, please. I want to know what's in your head.
S30E12_1100#Uh, you like beer?
S30E12_1101#I love beer!
S30E12_1104#Such a lovely family.
S30E12_1106#We're so glad we got to know you.
S30E12_1108#Actually, you didn't.
S30E12_1110#I lied about my family.
S30E12_1112#Mom, I'm so sorry, I was ashamed.
S30E12_1115#I feel worse than I've ever felt in my life.
S30E12_1118#It'll haunt for the person I become forever.
S30E12_1121#Aw, honey, I'm just as bad as you.
S30E12_1123#I coached your father and brother on how to act
S30E12_1125#to get through this dinner.
S30E12_1128#I've actually misled you myself.
S30E12_1130#I said I'm from Nigeria.
S30E12_1132#In truth, I moved there when I was two.
S30E12_1134#I'm from Cameroon.
S30E12_1136#Didn't you wonder why the man I told you was my father
S30E12_1139#didn't look like him?
S30E12_1141#I assumed he had lost all his hair
S30E12_1143#and put on an obscene amount of weight.
S30E12_1145#Well, it's really hard running your own business.
S30E12_1148#You don't run your own business.
S30E12_1150#I'm starting a new farce.
S30E12_1155#Wow, honesty really kills a party.
S30E12_1158#What do you say we all go kick it in my new room?
S30E12_1160#When did you get a new room?
S30E12_1161#While everyone was focused on Lisa,
S30E12_1163#I did a little remodel.
S30E12_1165#I didn't pull permits, but it's up to code.
S30E12_1171#Boy, why did you do this?
S30E12_1172#Where are you gonna sleep?
S30E12_1174#Eh, sleep's for farmers. I wanted a place to chill.
S30E12_1177#Oh, I get it.
S30E12_1178#Totally get it.
S30E12_1180#So, that's two more beers.
S30E12_1182#And... what were you drinking there, Cheryl?
S30E12_1187#Cranapple martini.
S30E12_1189#My first happy ending!
S30E12_1192#"I completely agree."
S30E12_1194#I love you, Mom!
S30E12_1197#I love you, Sam.
S30E12_1198#I love you, Bart.
S30E12_1200#And I love you,
S30E12_1201#room.
S30E12_1209#Disco Stu always pitchin' woo.
S30E12_1212#Ferocious, Drederick. You and the cheetah.
S30E12_1220#Let me in. I need to talk to the boy!
S30E12_1223#- This has gotten out of hand! - Not on the list.
S30E12_1225#Aw, come on, man, I know him. We hang out all the time.
S30E12_1227#Sure you do.
S30E12_1230#You can come in, sweetheart.
S30E12_1231#I'll take care of this, Homie.
S30E12_1238#Move along, sir. You're blocking the fire escape.
S28E22_116#he'll end up with everything you've got.
S28E22_118#But that's everything I got.
S28E22_120#Okay, kids, give me your best worried looks.
S28E22_123#Ooh, that's good worry.
S28E22_125#And Maggie, when we visit Gil,
S28E22_127#you should think about your mom and me disappearing forever
S28E22_130#any time we step behind a wall.
S28E22_134#Where am I?
S28E22_135#Where am I?
S28E22_139#No, seriously, where did I go?
S28E22_141#It's so dark in here.
S28E22_143#Maggie!
S28E22_148#Ol' Gil,
S28E22_149#there must be something we can do for you.
S28E22_154#Ah, there sure is, you can let me scratch your husband.
S28E22_156#Sure, but why?
S28E22_158#Because you're the lottery ticket
S28E22_160#I've been waiting for all my life!
S28E22_163#?Before this goes any further,
S28E22_165#can you just take one look at our darling daughters?
S28E22_167#Mr. Gunderson? 
S28E22_169#They don't let saxophones in the I.C.U.,
S28E22_172#so I'll just tell you the song I wrote for you.
S28E22_174#B-flat, C, D-flat...
S28E22_175#If memory serves, you have a son. ...
S28E22_176#B-flat, C...
S28E22_177#- Where's he at? - Long G.
S28E22_180#I'm here to give Mr. Gunderson his shot.
S28E22_183#Boy, the "Putting him in a coma" idea
S28E22_185#was just dinner table chatter.
S28E22_186#I did not sign off.
S28E22_188#You tapped your nose.
S28E22_189#I was scratching it.
S28E22_191#Well, I got to put something in a coma.
S28E22_195#Why, you little...
S28E22_199#Well, I'll see you in court.
S28E22_201#Ah, cha-cha-cha!
S28E22_202#Cha-cha-cha?
S28E22_203#That's hopeful.
S28E22_205#Cha-cha-ching!
S28E22_211#Your Honor, my client had just turned his life around.
S28E22_214#His daughter recently bought a washing machine
S28E22_217#and promised him the box to live in.
S28E22_219#Do you think they'll send Dad away forever?
S28E22_221#Oh, no, sweetie.
S28E22_223#They just want all our money.
S28E22_225#Will they send us to live with other families?
S28E22_232#Miss Simpson, from now on you shall live with us,
S28E22_236#receiving musical instruction from Mr. Adolphe Sax himself.
S28E22_239#Adolphe. A name that will only be associated
S28E22_242#with beautiful music.
S28E22_244#We'll be free to do whatever we want.
S28E22_247#A thousand bucks a kidney?
S28E22_248#Take them both.
S28E22_251#Ay, caramba!
S28E22_256#Mr. Simpson,
S28E22_257#you deliberately ran your car
S28E22_260#into my paycheck-- I-I mean, my client.
S28E22_262#No, "Paycheck" is better.
S28E22_264#What possible defense could you have?
S28E22_266#I had no other choice.
S28E22_268#I didn't want to hit a dog.
S28E22_270#A dog? ?He saved a dog?
S28E22_271#He was gonna save a dog. 
S28E22_273#People love dogs.
S28E22_275#This is our key to winning this case.
S28E22_276#You're on my side, right?
S28E22_277#I am.
S28E22_281#Now, go ahead, son.
S28E22_283#You tell us how you got your dog.
S28E22_285#It was Christmas, sir.
S28E22_287#We saved him and he saved us.
S28E22_290#Now, we love the dog,
S28E22_292#and the dog gives us all the love we could handle.
S28E22_294#Love.
S28E22_297#Could the stenographer read that last part back
S28E22_299#with sentimental music?
S28E22_301#"The dog gives us all the love
S28E22_303#we could handle. Love."
S28E22_307#Does the defendant ask this court
S28E22_309#to believe that in order to avoid hitting a dog,
S28E22_312#it is acceptable to hit a human?
S28E22_314#My client?
S28E22_316#It's looking good, Homie. According to our consultant,
S28E22_318#the toughest nut to crack is juror number six.
S28E22_321#Aw, good doggy.
S28E22_324#Ladies and gentlemen, this man is a human being,
S28E22_327#just like you or me.
S28E22_329#Surely his life has more value
S28E22_332#than some creature that scoots its buttocks along the ground.
S28E22_337#Or-or gets its head stuck
S28E22_339#in an empty pickle jar.
S28E22_342#Or walks on a hot sidewalk
S28E22_344#in a way that suggests it's dancing!
S28E22_349#This is ridiculous. I'm a human being here,
S28E22_352#not some dumb animal.
S28E22_353#What? ?I never.
S28E22_355#Who are you calling dumb?
S28E22_357#The dogs who sniff for bombs at the airport?
S28E22_361#The St. Bernards who save lives on the slopes of St. Moritz?
S28E22_364#Or this one?
S28E22_373#Now, I have a brief instruction for the jury:
S28E22_375#"There's more sanctity in a dog's loyalty
S28E22_378#than there is in all your human laws."
S28E22_384#Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, how...
S28E22_386#Not guilty.
S28E22_387#Case dismissed.
S28E22_390#We won! It's all because of you, boy.
S28E22_394#I have never been more glad
S28E22_396#that I didn't hit you with my car,
S28E22_398#secretly bury you, get another greyhound,
S28E22_400#paint it your exact coloring, then realize it's a girl,
S28E22_403#stick on a fake wang, and pretend that she's you
S28E22_405#for however long dogs live.
S28E22_412#Take us to the dog park!
S28E22_415#I know I've been through a lot,
S28E22_417#but I always believed people cared about a human being
S28E22_419#more than a dog.
S28E22_422#Hold it, I forgot my phone charger.
S28E22_429#Oh, wait, this isn't mine.
S28E22_434#It's now official: a Springfield jury has decided
S28E22_437#that the life of this greyhound is more valuable
S28E22_439#than the life of this Greyhound station inhabitant.
S28E22_443#Look at me, I'm a big man. A big man!
S28E22_445#Anybody got a quarter?
S28E22_446#Got to be a quarter,
S28E22_448#not two dimes and a nickel.
S28E22_449#That ain't worth jack.
S28E22_451#What's your take on all this, Anger Watkins?
S28E22_453#I'm angrier than a beehive in a paint mixer.
S28E22_456#This is the craziest legal decision
S28E22_458#ever made outside of Arizona.
S28E22_460#What's next? Cats get credit cards?
S28E22_462#Let a snail race in the Indy 500?
S28E22_465#Like that stupid movie Turbo?
S28E22_467#I tried to inhale nitrous oxide to get fast.
S28E22_469#I ended up naked behind an appliance store!
S28E22_471#Lies!
S28E22_473#Lies! Lies!
S28E22_476#Oh, you're gonna get ten walks a day, boy.
S28E22_479#You can even bite the mailman.
S28E22_482#There he is.
S28E22_484#America's number one doggy daddy.
S28E22_487#Would you care to do the honors?
S28E22_488#Would I!
S28E22_490#Uh, that's what I asked.
S28E22_491#Would you?
S28E22_495#You're the greatest man I know one thing about!
S28E22_504#Look at all those voters.
S28E22_506#What is our current position on dogs?
S28E22_508#We currently have a city employee
S28E22_510#who rounds them up and puts them to sleep.
S28E22_512#What? I can't believe such a jerk
S28E22_514#would even be elected dog catcher.
S28E22_516#From this point forth, this town will be known
S28E22_518#as the dog-loving capital of the world.
S28E22_521#That'll put Springfield on the map.
S28E22_523#Yeah, why aren't we on the map?
S28E22_523#I don't know.
S28E22_525#I made, like, 20 calls to Rand McNally.
S28E22_528#They don't even know what state we're in.
S28E22_530#Thanks to these hastily-passed untested pandering laws,
S28E22_534#Springfield is now the most dog-friendly city in America.
S28E22_577#Is there anything here the dogs haven't gotten into?
S28E22_579#Just the dog food.
S28E22_581#Why are you shutting me down?
S28E22_583#You made a dog wait for a teeth cleaning
S28E22_585#while you saved a racehorse's life?
S28E22_588#And you call yourself a veterinarian. Ha.
S28E22_591#And you know what we found inside?
S28E22_593#Dogs in cages.
S28E22_595#That's no way to treat man's best friend.
S28E22_596#Lock him up.
S28E22_597#In a cage.
S28E22_598#Like a dog.
S28E22_599#Don't you understand?
S28E22_601#Dogs are born to follow and obey.
S28E22_604#The moment the pack realizes
S28E22_606#that humans are no longer their masters,
S28E22_609#thousands of years of domestication will fall away.
S28E22_612#They'll revert to their wild wolf nature.
S28E22_614#Well, then I guess you'll be happy
S28E22_616#being nice and safe in jail.
S28E22_619#Oh, yes, please! Take me there now.
S28E22_621#You're all doomed!
S28E22_623#Doomed.
S28E22_626#Santa's Little Helper didn't come home last night.
S28E22_629#If you were a dog these days, would you come home?
S28E22_631#It's like doggy heaven out there, only real.
S28E22_633#Doggy heaven isn't real?
S28E22_635#No! No, it's real!
S28E22_636#The dogs all have harps and wings.
S28E22_638#How do they play harps if they don't have fingers?
S28E22_641#Um... dogs have fingers in heaven.
S28E22_643#How do you know so much about dog heaven?
S28E22_645#I died for five minutes and was sent there by mistake.
S28E22_647#Now, leave me alone.
S28E22_654#Come on, girl.
S28E22_656#Ow! Ow, ow. Just get him by the collar.
S28E22_658#You can do it. Come on, don't bite me.
S28E22_661#Come on. Pull. Come on.
S28E22_663#Dad, we don't have time for this.
S28E22_665#Quiet. I'm doing something important.
S28E22_667#There you go. Yes, that's it!
S28E22_669#Well, well, well,
S28E22_671#look what the cat dragged in.
S28E22_674#- Worth it. - ?Totally worth it.
S28E22_675#I know.
S28E22_684#Kirk, Taquito is digging up my dahlias.
S28E22_686#Stop him. ?Mm.
S28E22_688#Sorry. ?
S28E22_690#Please don't hurt me.
S28E22_692#I'm exposing my belly.
S28E22_694#See? Exposing. Exposing!
S28E22_716#See ya later, Moe!
S28E22_720#Huh? My car's not starting.
S28E22_722#Oh, I see the problem.
S28E22_724#Out of gas.
S28E22_726#Well, probably safer to walk anyway.
S28E22_731#Yep, nothing safer than walking.
S28E22_733#This is so healthy.
S28E22_735#Thanks to this walk, I'll live a lot longer.
S28E22_746#Hey, here come some of my four-footed friends.
S28E22_748#I guess you want to meet the guy who's responsible
S28E22_751#for making all your lives better.
S28E22_754#Okay, wait a minute. Let me guess.
S28E22_756#Collie, dachshund, Tibetan Mastiff,
S28E22_758#otterhound, Swedish Vallhund,
S28E22_760#Finnish Spitz, Norwegian Lundehund,
S28E22_763#Catahoula Leopard Dog, Lagotto Romagnolo,
S28E22_766#and three wolves!
S28E22_770#Stand back! Back!
S28E22_775#You don't scare me.
S28E22_777#Your bark is worse than your bite.
S28E22_780#Oh, those horrible barks!
S28E22_787#Dr. Budgie warned them.
S28E22_789#Dr. Budgie warned all of them.
S28E22_791#But did they listen to Dr. Budgie?
S28E22_793#All right, that's it. I'm comin' in there!
S28E22_795#Oh, for cryin' out...
S28E22_797#Maybe if I turn sideways.
S28E22_800#Lou, get the bar butter!
S28E22_803#This is what happens when you buy European prison cells.
S28E22_809#Kids, lower the Purge armor!
S28E22_811#We don't have any Purge armor.
S28E22_813#Oh, right. I always mean to buy it the day after the Purge,
S28E22_816#- when it's cheaper. - What happened?
S28E22_817#The dogs have gone savage!
S28E22_819#They've taken over the town!
S28E22_821#No, boy.
S28E22_823#Resist the call of the wild.
S28E22_825#Like I did when they assigned that book for summer reading.
S28E22_827#Somebody help! Stop him!
S28E22_835#Oh, we've lost him to the pack.
S28E22_837#No, he's a good dog.
S28E22_838#He'd never turn against us.
S28E22_841#Hmm, he's ripping the stuffing out of your car seats.
S28E22_843#Oh, yeah?!
S28E22_844#You think you're so smart?!
S28E22_846#Okay! I'm eating your dog food!
S28E22_849#This is on you!
S28E22_859#Not one student showed up to school
S28E22_861#just because a pack of ferocious, masterless dogs
S28E22_864#are roaming the playground.
S28E22_866#Damn it!
S28E22_868#I thought we sent Willie out there to deal with them.
S28E22_871#I did. But he, uh, hasn't returned.
S28E22_874#I've finally been accepted for who I truly am.
S28E22_886#How come I don't get a dog-proof suit?
S28E22_888#Because I smell like lamb, Lou.
S28E22_890#Very well. You were right and we were wrong.
S28E22_893#Yes. Um, can you remove the shackles?
S28E22_896#Don't push your luck.
S28E22_898#These dogs, they walk around all high and mighty,
S28E22_901#no regard for anyone else on the planet.
S28E22_903#I mean, that's humans' job!
S28E22_905#Repeal the stupid new laws!
S28E22_908#Yes. Repeal the dog--
S28E22_910#and child labor-- laws!
S28E22_912#Fine, just the dog ones.
S28E22_914#- I say "Status," You say... - Quo!
S28E22_917#So passed!
S28E22_919#Well, everything's back to normal again.
S28E22_922#It's a pity no one told the dogs that.
S28E22_926#You fools have surrendered your position as alpha dogs.
S28E22_929#Until you reassert human dominance,
S28E22_932#it is you who will be calling these savage canines master.
S28E22_936#Who among you is brave enough to tame this slobbering horde?
S28E22_943#Well, I guess it's up to ol' Gil.
S28E22_945#Gil? Why are you helping these people
S28E22_947#who think so little of you?
S28E22_948#That's why I'm doin' it!
S28E22_951#To show everyone I'm not the town failure.
S28E22_954#I thought I was the town failure!
S28E22_956#You're not even that.
S28E22_959#So who will come with me?!
S28E22_960#None of us!
S28E22_961#One more time!
S28E22_963#Nobody!
S28E22_964#I can't hear you!
S28E22_966#Yes, you can!
S28E22_969#Standing next to me
S28E22_971#is the man whose life we all agreed
S28E22_973#was worth less than a dog.
S28E22_976#I say we stand behind him as he redeems himself!
S28E22_979#Even though he did nothing wrong.
S28E22_981#Gil, Gil, Gil, Gil,
S28E22_983#Gil, Gil, Gil, Gil, Gil,
S28E22_985#Gil, Gil!
S28E22_990#We've got to get Santa's Little Helper back.
S28E22_993#It's too dangerous!
S28E22_995#You kids ain't goin' nowhere!
S28E22_996#I got this.
S28E22_1002#Fine. But we can't go out alone.
S28E22_1004#We need someone who knows how to fend off angry dogs.
S28E22_1010#Here, boy! Come on, boy!
S28E22_1011#Oh, where can he be?
S28E22_1030#Grampa, I called to make sure the kids are okay.
S28E22_1032#They're not okay! The boy's got sass,
S28E22_1035#and the girl thinks she's Queen of the May.
S28E22_1038#You leave 'em with me and I'll straighten 'em out!
S28E22_1040#I did leave them with you.
S28E22_1042#Why the hell would you do that?!
S28E22_1044#Here, boy. Here, boy. Here, boy.
S28E22_1052#It's the alpha.
S28E22_1057#I know that dog.
S28E22_1058#It's the one Milhouse got
S28E22_1060#when he didn't wet the bed for a week.
S28E22_1070#We're about to die at the hands of a dog!
S28E22_1072#Paws. Dogs have paws.
S28E22_1074#Just remember the last thing you did in life was correct me.
S28E22_1077#Oh, that actually makes me feel better.
S28E22_1086#This has gone on long enough!
S28E22_1089#You sit!
S28E22_1097#I'm sorry!
S28E22_1101#Mom, you've become the alpha dog!
S28E22_1104#Dogs are nice. I love dogs.
S28E22_1106#Because, in dogs, we see the things we wish
S28E22_1108#we saw more of in people:
S28E22_1111#lifelong friendship, unwavering loyalty,
S28E22_1114#and a willingness to eat anything you cook.
S28E22_1117#You rang?
S28E22_1119#Ol' Gil's here to save the day!
S28E22_1121#Where are those out of control pooches?
S28E22_1123#Sorry, ol' Gil, you're too late.
S28E22_1125#But-but I was supposed to redeem myself
S28E22_1128#and finally earn the town's respect.
S28E22_1129#Uh, good job, Gil.
S28E22_1132#You had to stop at the Automat for an egg salad sandwich.
S28E22_1135#Well, at least you still have the sandwich.
S28E22_1141#Baz, you belong with the Flanders.
S28E22_1142#Okily-dokily.
S28E22_1143#Dalmatian, fire department.
S28E22_1147#Mr. Burns, the hounds.
S28E22_1148#Excellent.
S28E22_1150#Uh, since you were gone,
S28E22_1152#all I had to release were the June bugs.
S28E22_1156#Willie, Skinner.
S28E22_1158#Aw, good boy.
S28E22_1165#*Oh, you're my best friend*
S28E22_1171#*Ooh, you make me live now, honey*
S28E22_1173#*Ooh, you make me live...*
S28E22_1174#You'll have your day.
S28E22_1178#It's gotta be hard
S28E22_1180#to cheer me up after this day.
S28E22_1184#Hey little fellow there, a bad night too.
S28E22_1187#Come out here. I won't hurt you.
S28E22_1191#You just licked away a very bad day.
S28E22_1195#Atta boy.
S30E13_62#I-I'll be on the next plane.
S30E13_64#What's wrong, honey?
S30E13_66#My Aunt Eunice is dying.
S30E13_68#I have to leave right away.
S30E13_70#Oh, poor Marge.
S30E13_72#Wait. She said "I," not "We."
S30E13_74#I don't have to go.
S30E13_82#Aw, you love her, too.
S30E13_90#Sweetie, do you want to come?
S30E13_92#Uh, uh, w-with all my heart.
S30E13_95#Uh, but the children need me.
S30E13_108#Y'ello.
S30E13_110#Dad, I am begging you.
S30E13_111#Who is this?
S30E13_114#Okay.
S30E13_115#I made a loaf of peanut butter and jelly.
S30E13_117#You just have to slice it into sandwiches every day.
S30E13_119#- Check. - I set the Roomba up
S30E13_121#to cope with your cleaning.
S30E13_128#- Check. - I made a welcome wagon basket
S30E13_130#for our new neighbors from Eastern Europe.
S30E13_132#- Check. - Not Czech, Slovenian.
S30E13_134#Check.
S30E13_137#One last thing-- this is very important, Homer.
S30E13_141#The new season of Odder Stuff drops on Netflix tonight.
S30E13_143#Ooh, ooh. Something to do.
S30E13_145#Do not watch it without me.
S30E13_148#What? Why not? I have to see if my fan theories are correct.
S30E13_152#I think it's set in the '80s.
S30E13_154#Homer, the nine hours
S30E13_157#we binge watch that show together is our thing.
S30E13_160#And we don't have a lot of things.
S30E13_162#But holding hands in a darkened room
S30E13_165#with my head on your shoulder
S30E13_168#has become the glue that seals our love.
S30E13_171#I get it. I totally get it.
S30E13_172#I know I'm not perfect.
S30E13_174#Sometimes I forget our marriage birthday.
S30E13_177#- Our anniversary? - Yes.
S30E13_179#And sometimes I forget your birth anniversary,
S30E13_181#but I promise I will not watch our show without you.
S30E13_184#Thank you, Homie.
S30E13_186#Thank you girls for coming.
S30E13_189#Dearest, you were always our favorite aunt.
S30E13_192#Psst, over here.
S30E13_194#When she's gone, I get the P's,
S30E13_195#Selma gets the S's.
S30E13_197#You get to notify the utilities.
S30E13_200#Can't this wait until after she's dead?
S30E13_202#I'll be too busy grieving.
S30E13_204#Yeah. Too busy grieving I got the salt shaker.
S30E13_208#Easy-peasy. "P" for salt, "S" for pepper.
S30E13_212#I'm walking towards a light...
S30E13_215#...with a Post-it on it.
S30E13_220#Okay, sweetie, here's a book
S30E13_222#that can help you fall asleep.
S30E13_225#No, no, no. No, sweetie.
S30E13_227#You chew it, like this. Look.
S30E13_231#Yummy book. Mmm.
S30E13_242#Hey, what?
S30E13_247#What's this? What are you doing?!
S30E13_249#You guys can't watch this.
S30E13_251#Uh, no. You can't watch this.
S30E13_253#We didn't promise Mom nothing.
S30E13_257#Children, there are 400 shows you could watch right now.
S30E13_260#Many with Ted Danson.
S30E13_268#Wait for me.
S30E13_272#This show you can watch.
S30E13_273#Too depressing.
S30E13_279#Oh. Ah! No.
S30E13_282#Must find place to avoid pop culture discussions.
S30E13_285#I know. The watercooler.
S30E13_288#-...the Semi-Gorgon. -...so many twists.
S30E13_290#-I know. -...set in the '80s.
S30E13_291#And the Guffer Brothers.
S30E13_293#My turn to talk about how much I liked it.
S30E13_295#Shouldn't doing something nice for your wife
S30E13_297#feel better than this?
S30E13_298#Homer
S30E13_299#will you read my Odder Stuff fan fiction?
S30E13_301#I threw it over Stephen King's fence
S30E13_303#but I-it hit him on the head.
S30E13_304#Why Stephen King?
S30E13_306#Eh, he's got a low fence.
S30E13_311#Don't worry, kids.
S30E13_313#Sideshow Mel will be fine.
S30E13_315#He has an air bubble.
S30E13_317#It's all carbon dioxide now!
S30E13_322#This is the last time
S30E13_324#I buy a trick from a magician's widow.
S30E13_332#Nobody's watching my show.
S30E13_334#What with the downloading and the streaming,
S30E13_337#and the fact that everything else is better.
S30E13_338#Now, you're my writers!
S30E13_340#You pay us like interns.
S30E13_341#And I'm your niece.
S30E13_344#Now I want ideas.
S30E13_346#Why don't we do another live special?
S30E13_348#What? I can't remember lines.
S30E13_350#At my last wedding I wrote "I do"
S30E13_352#on the rabbi's forehead.
S30E13_354#You could hide a golden ticket in some candy like Willy Wonka.
S30E13_357#The only children allowed in my factory
S30E13_359#are the ones that work there.
S30E13_361#How 'bout we have a contest?
S30E13_363#Some lucky kid gets to run around a Krusty store
S30E13_365#for five whole minutes and take all the toys they want.
S30E13_368#It inspires buying, it's easy to promote,
S30E13_371#and it's the third thing someone pitched.
S30E13_372#I'm sold!
S30E13_384#Let's see what else Netflix has to offer.
S30E13_388#"Because you watched an '80s show featuring a monster..."
S30E13_391#Alf, Roseanne,
S30E13_392#Moonlighting, The Cosby Show--
S30E13_394#They're all too scary.
S30E13_399#God forgive me.
S30E13_405#No. Only when we're together.
S30E13_406#It's our glue.
S30E13_408#Homer, I'm Ted Sarandos.
S30E13_409#Chief Content Officer of Netflix.
S30E13_413#This can't be a dream because I don't know who you are.
S30E13_416#I'm not a dream. Let's just say I'm a manifestation
S30E13_418#of complex algorithms that know everything about you.
S30E13_421#Well, I can't watch this because...
S30E13_423#I know. I know. Marge told you not to.
S30E13_425#Do you know that she's been watching
S30E13_428#Scandinavian crime dramas with full nudity without you?
S30E13_431#That nudity is story-driven.
S30E13_432#Yeah, right.
S30E13_434#But Odder Stuff is our thing.
S30E13_436#No. Your thing's with us.
S30E13_438#She's just along for the ride.
S30E13_439#The account's in your name.
S30E13_441#Come on, come on, watch it now.
S30E13_443#Because our subscription prices will triple tomorrow.
S30E13_469#Wow. I finally finished something
S30E13_471#I wasn't supposed to start.
S30E13_472#That is impressive.
S30E13_474#I won't even mind watching it again with...
S30E13_475#Homer?!
S30E13_477#The lady from my marriage.
S30E13_480#My aunt recovered.
S30E13_482#Why are you up at 5:00 A.M.?
S30E13_485#Still warm.
S30E13_488#You watched it.
S30E13_492#I finally learn how little I mean to you.
S30E13_495#Wait.
S30E13_498#No.
S30E13_512#Marge, I am sorry.
S30E13_515#Come on, it's a stupid TV show.
S30E13_518#I don't want to hear your voice.
S30E13_525#No. We're staying married.
S30E13_530#Enough with the rebuses.
S30E13_532#All right, I'll just grab my pillow and sleep on the couch.
S30E13_535#No. You'll sleep right next to me.
S30E13_540#Because I want you to feel the bitter rays
S30E13_544#of ice coming from my frozen soul.
S30E13_555#Oh. Oh. It's so bitterly cold.
S30E13_563#I'm fine.
S30E13_565#To enter our contest,
S30E13_567#write down, in 15 words or less,
S30E13_569#why you love me more than God and America.
S30E13_572#The top three essayists will earn a chance
S30E13_574#to run roughshod through a Krusty store
S30E13_577#and not get tased by security.
S30E13_581#Whoever fills the cart with the most toys
S30E13_584#gets to keep them, free.
S30E13_587#And the other two get the worst kind of squat: diddly.
S30E13_590#Diddly? You can't say that word on TV.
S30E13_594#Employees and monkeys of this network are not eligible.
S30E13_599#Lis, will you write my essay for me?
S30E13_601#What, you can't even come up with,
S30E13_603#"I love Krusty because I'm a class clown
S30E13_606#and he's a clown with class"?
S30E13_608#Perfect. And the best thing is I'm stealing it from you.
S30E13_611#Ooh, that'll impress 'em.
S30E13_613#Go ahead. But there's one thing I want you to hear:
S30E13_616#when you win by cheating, eventually you lose.
S30E13_618#Wait, sorry, after you said "win,"
S30E13_620#I started thinking about dirt bikes.
S30E13_633#You cheated on your wife, Homer.
S30E13_636#I waited for Lenny before I watched.
S30E13_640#After this, we've got a stand-up special
S30E13_641#from Chris Rock.
S30E13_643#Don't watch that with your wife, either.
S30E13_653#Quit sleeping in the garden!
S30E13_662#Dad?
S30E13_665#Sweetie, everything's fine.
S30E13_668#Dad, maybe you should be talking to someone who's older than me.
S30E13_670#Ted Sarandos?
S30E13_672#Who's Ted Sarandos?
S30E13_674#I was hoping you knew.
S30E13_676#Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
S30E13_678#My son, what are your sins?
S30E13_681#Aside from thinking our church has confession.
S30E13_684#I watched a binge-worthy TV show without my wife.
S30E13_687#Was it The Crown? Don't tell me how it ends.
S30E13_689#Doesn't she become queen?
S30E13_690#Oh, go to Hell.
S30E13_693#Aw, what am I gonna do?
S30E13_694#I don't know what she wants!
S30E13_696#Homer, sorry to blow my own horn...
S30E13_700#...but Netflix knows your wife better than you do.
S30E13_702#Do you know what she watches incessantly
S30E13_703#when you're not around?
S30E13_705#Usually this thing.
S30E13_708#Dance shows! She loves 'em!
S30E13_711#Want to win her back? Learn to dance, my puppet.
S30E13_714#Hmm. I have disappointed Marge with my dancing in the past.
S30E13_724#I'll do it!
S30E13_737#Did you guys all let down your wives?
S30E13_739#I'm not that pathetic.
S30E13_742#I'm just paying $40 an hour for basic human contact.
S30E13_750#Hello. My name is Julia.
S30E13_752#Just remember Julia believes in you.
S30E13_754#Julia will always believe in you.
S30E13_756#Julia will stay with you until you are a dancer.
S30E13_759#- What's my name? - Homer.
S30E13_761#- No. My name. - Julia.
S30E13_762#And why are you here?
S30E13_763#I need to learn how to dance
S30E13_765#- to get my wife back. - Aww
S30E13_769#It's been a long time since a woman said that to me.
S30E13_779#Now we begin.
S30E13_788#Zoey B, Zoey T, you work with these guys.
S30E13_790#This man needs one-on-one help.
S30E13_793#I don't know how to tell you this,
S30E13_794#but you are a terrible dancer.
S30E13_796#Uh, it seems like you did know how to tell me that.
S30E13_799#But I am taking you on as my personal challenge,
S30E13_803#and when I take on a challenge, I don't quit!
S30E13_810#Okay, here's the first thing:
S30E13_812#when you step on my toe, it causes me pain.
S30E13_815#Wow. I'm learning so much.
S30E13_827#How's your toe?
S30E13_828#Doesn't matter.
S30E13_830#I don't quit and neither do you.
S30E13_843#Homer, you're getting there.
S30E13_845#You're aware of when the music is playing.
S30E13_848#Can't... dance.
S30E13_850#Marriage over.
S30E13_852#Will live... on boat.
S30E13_856#I'm gonna have to do something I didn't want to do.
S30E13_858#I'm bringing in my partner.
S30E13_859#Sweet Sal!
S30E13_863#Watch me. With one hand, you can lead a woman.
S30E13_866#- I find that hard to...  - You have to come forward
S30E13_867#- when I do this. - Mm?
S30E13_869#- You have to go back when I do this. - Mm.
S30E13_871#As I push my palm into your back,
S30E13_873#- you're forced to turn here. - I am. I am.
S30E13_880#Back straight! Knees bent!
S30E13_882#Feet arched! Eyes merry!
S30E13_898#Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking.
S30E13_900#Homer? Nah, sorry, Midge.
S30E13_902#I ain't seen him in weeks.
S30E13_903#What do you mean?
S30E13_905#He told me he's been there every night.
S30E13_907#Oh, oh, Homer Simpson.
S30E13_909#Oh, no, I thought you were talking about,
S30E13_911#uh, Homer the blind poet who wrote the Iliad
S30E13_913#and the Odyssey there, yeah.
S30E13_915#'Cause he ain't been around since, like, 720 BC.
S30E13_934#Another night at Moe's?
S30E13_936#Yeah. I'm beat.
S30E13_937#The couch.
S30E13_947#Quiet!
S30E13_952#Okay, Homer, time to do a lift.
S30E13_954#Are you sure? I'm pretty heavy.
S30E13_956#No, me. Just grab my waist and hold on tight.
S30E13_959#I'm doing all the work.
S30E13_963#We'll work on that.
S30E13_966#It's time for Krusty's Toy Trample!
S30E13_969#We have three finalists.
S30E13_971#But only the first finisher gets to keep his toys.
S30E13_974#Losers have to pay the winner's income tax.
S30E13_978#We rehearsed this with monkeys, and everything went great!
S30E13_984#Now, to take out these two losers in two seconds.
S30E13_988#Dead Grandma, is that you?
S30E13_990#On your marks,
S30E13_992#prepare to advance.
S30E13_994#Commence!
S30E13_1009#- No! - No!
S30E13_1031#Congratulations, kid!
S30E13_1034#And you also won... A day with Krusty!
S30E13_1036#Day with Krusty will actually be
S30E13_1037#day with Sideshow Mel.
S30E13_1039#Don't we get anything?
S30E13_1041#Of course. You two get the greatest prize
S30E13_1043#any kid could ask for:
S30E13_1045#wooden paddles with balls on 'em.
S30E13_1048#Mine's broken already.
S30E13_1049#Use your imagination.
S30E13_1051#The ball is a rocket ship, and the paddle is a...
S30E13_1055#I don't know. Why am I wasting my time with this kid?
S30E13_1058#- Is he dying? - Not that I know of.
S30E13_1060#Well, then get him outta here!
S30E13_1063#Marge, it's me.
S30E13_1064#I want to ask you one favor,
S30E13_1066#and I won't bother you again.
S30E13_1067#There's a dress in the bedroom.
S30E13_1069#Put it on and meet me at 15th and Elm.
S30E13_1070#Are you going to tell me
S30E13_1072#where you've been spending your nights?
S30E13_1074#All will be made clear.
S30E13_1077#Marge, go to him.
S30E13_1079#If you don't, he'll head off to the war,
S30E13_1081#and you'll never see him again.
S30E13_1083#He's not going to war.
S30E13_1085#That coward! He doesn't deserve my daughter!
S30E13_1091#She's here.
S30E13_1103#You look beautiful.
S30E13_1105#Cut it out.
S30E13_1106#Why are we here?
S30E13_1109#To dance.
S30E13_1110#I don't know how.
S30E13_1113#Marge, all you have to do is one incredibly difficult thing:
S30E13_1115#trust me.
S30E13_1117#{\an9}*I'm here*
S30E13_1122#{\an9}*Let's dance*
S30E13_1127#{\an9}*My dear*
S30E13_1131#{\an9}*What's your name*
S30E13_1136#{\an9}*How do you do*
S30E13_1140#{\an9}*What's the game*
S30E13_1146#{\an9}*Hallelujah*
S30E13_1150#{\an9}*I saw a girl*
S30E13_1153#I've never seen this:
S30E13_1156#Mom and Dad romantically in love.
S30E13_1159#It's like rebirth.
S30E13_1162#It cures all the wounds.
S30E13_1167#Bart, are you seeing this?
S30E13_1169#I set a new record: 89.
S30E13_1173#Wha... You missed the greatest moment in our parents' lives.
S30E13_1175#89's pretty good.
S30E13_1178#{\an9}*How do you do*
S30E13_1183#Whoo! I have not felt this good since I signed Shonda Rhimes.
S30E13_1186#{\an9}*You're there*
S30E13_1190#{\an9}*I'm here*
S30E13_1191#Okay, Homer, catch and lift.
S30E13_1196#{\an9}*But let's dance*
S30E13_1200#{\an9}*My dear*
S30E13_1204#{\an9}*What's your name*
S30E13_1209#{\an9}*How do you do*
S30E13_1213#{\an9}*What's the game*
S30E13_1221#Wait, how did you get a toy?
S30E13_1223#It was a thank-you from Ralph for writing his essay.
S30E13_1226#You wrote Ralph's essay, too?
S30E13_1228#It's called hedging your bets, boys.
S30E13_1231#Hi-yo, just desserts!
S30E13_1233#Did someone say "Just desserts"?
S30E13_1236#Dad, it's just an expression.
S30E13_1239#Just an expression, eh?
S30E13_1241#I have to warn you, we just have desserts.
S30E14_55#Yeah. Hey, no, aw, that's my ear bu... Ew.
S30E14_59#It's yours now.
S30E14_62#Wow. That's incredible, Krusty.
S30E14_64#I mean, really, I'm blown away.
S30E14_66#Yeah, well, it's true. It's absolutely true.
S30E14_68#I have a phobia... of pies.
S30E14_72#That's so crazy because, I mean, we've all seen you get
S30E14_75#hit in the face with pies on your show.
S30E14_77#No, no, no, those are cakes decorated as pies.
S30E14_81#Oh, right, so that's how you make yourself feel safe.
S30E14_84#It's not the crust; it's the fillings.
S30E14_87#Krusty, I got to ask you about something,
S30E14_89#and-and I don't want you to get defensive,
S30E14_91#but it's something you've never talked about.
S30E14_93#Can you tell me about The Sands of Space?
S30E14_96#Oh, no. That's off-limits, soul patch!
S30E14_99#We could talk about the exploding milkshakes
S30E14_100#in your Laffy Meals.
S30E14_102#Did they ever find those kids' noses?
S30E14_104#Okay, okay, I'll tell you about The Sands of Space,
S30E14_108#the movie that almost consumed my soul.
S30E14_112#Yeah, yeah, keep talking.
S30E14_113#I'm just feeding the cats.
S30E14_116#It all began back in the golden age of Hollywood,
S30E14_120#the late 1980s, when high concept was king.
S30E14_123#You'd mix two kooky words together in the title,
S30E14_126#put a rap song at the end that explains the plot,
S30E14_129#and bam-- you're on the cover of Premiere magazine.
S30E14_133#I had starred in the hit action buddy comedy
S30E14_136#Good Cop, Dog Cop,
S30E14_138#where I played a murdered police officer
S30E14_141#who is reincarnated as his partner's pet Saint Bernard.
S30E14_145#Five smashed squad cars, 100 exploded helicopters,
S30E14_148#and the mayor's wife has fleas.
S30E14_150#Turn in your badge and your collar.
S30E14_152#You're suspended for a month!
S30E14_154#For me, that's like seven months.
S30E14_156#Dog Cop!
S30E14_159#Suddenly, everyone in town
S30E14_161#was dying to be in the Krusty business,
S30E14_164#and I was dipping shrimp with all the big talents
S30E14_167#I once longed to see fail.
S30E14_170#And, of course, what the studio wanted most was a sequel.
S30E14_173#Okay, Krusty, we've got
S30E14_175#Good Cop, Dog Cop 2: Golden Revolver all lined up.
S30E14_178#We, uh... who-who did the...
S30E14_180#The two Terrys, they just turned in a great script.
S30E14_183#Savage Sam Borgberg is all set to direct.
S30E14_185#So when do we start?
S30E14_187#I get it. You think I'm just some hack,
S30E14_190#out to churn out lazy sequels for a quick buck.
S30E14_193#Yes.
S30E14_195#This is my next movie.
S30E14_198#The Sands of Space?
S30E14_199#Krusty, are you kidding me?
S30E14_201#This is the most famously un-filmable book in history.
S30E14_205#It made Kubrick a recluse. It-it drove Coppola to wine.
S30E14_208#The four Jeffs tried to write a script,
S30E14_210#but even they couldn't crack it.
S30E14_212#When I bought this at an adult bookstore by mistake,
S30E14_215#it changed my life.
S30E14_217#"There's a light that shines from star to star,
S30E14_221#from soul to soul, connecting everyone in the universe."
S30E14_227#It's not landing for me that the hero doesn't
S30E14_230#refuse the quest before he accepts the quest.
S30E14_232#Is that landing for you?
S30E14_234#Look, I'm not drinking out of one more toilet
S30E14_237#until you green-light this movie.
S30E14_239#And I'm not playing a dog, either.
S30E14_242#All right, we got a comic who wants to make
S30E14_244#a hippie-dippie science-fiction vanity project.
S30E14_247#Here's what we do: we humor him, and we make it dirt cheap.
S30E14_250#We could shoot it in Mexico for nothing.
S30E14_252#We hire a has-been to direct it
S30E14_254#and never-wases to do everything else.
S30E14_257#After it bombs, that clown will come scooting his butt back here
S30E14_261#to make all the Dog Cop movies we want. Two more.
S30E14_265#The Sands of Space was a go,
S30E14_267#and the studio hired the least-qualified crew
S30E14_269#they could find, including a young couple
S30E14_272#whose love was just starting to bloom.
S30E14_274#She was full of optimism,
S30E14_277#and he was slightly less fat than he was going to be.
S30E14_279#What could be cooler?
S30E14_282#You and me working on a movie together all summer long
S30E14_285#as production assistants.
S30E14_288#It's so romantic.
S30E14_290#We'll be like Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton
S30E14_292#if they had to get coffee for everybody.
S30E14_298#All right, everyone, saddle up for Ju¨¢rez, Mexico.
S30E14_301#That's where I shot Manhattan Mix Up.
S30E14_304#Lost a lot of good men on that show.
S30E14_306#Now, move it out!
S30E14_318#Why are we stopping?
S30E14_320#Oh, the bus has been leaking oil for miles.
S30E14_321#Look behind us.
S30E14_323#Those things were literal?
S30E14_333#The Sands of Space, day one, shot one, take one.
S30E14_337#And... action!
S30E14_340#So barren, so alien,
S30E14_342#yet somehow... familiar.
S30E14_345#Hey, what the hell is this?
S30E14_346#Cut. Cut it!
S30E14_349#This sand is sand-colored. It's supposed to be red.
S30E14_352#So what? Sand is sand.
S30E14_354#Did you even read the book?
S30E14_357#These blood dunes are all that's left of humanity
S30E14_359#after the Rust Wars.
S30E14_361#What's to read? It's a space picture.
S30E14_364#Laser cars, girls with octopus arms,
S30E14_367#zip zap glip glorp, and it's in the can.
S30E14_369#Look, you no-talent bag of wrinkles.
S30E14_371#Go back to whatever Toluca Lake drunk tank
S30E14_373#they fished you out of,
S30E14_375#because you're not getting anywhere near my movie!
S30E14_380#Sir, I've worked in moving pictures
S30E14_383#since they were called "Stillies."
S30E14_385#I once shot a two-hour picture in 90 minutes.
S30E14_389#And so I say to you, in the words of Miss Lillian Gish,
S30E14_392#go crap in your hat.
S30E14_397#And now, if you'll excuse me,
S30E14_399#I am going to mysteriously drown in the ocean.
S30E14_406#As you may have heard, there's been an amicable parting of ways
S30E14_409#with that moron director. We wish him well.
S30E14_413#Clearly, there's only one artist close enough to this film
S30E14_416#to direct it: me.
S30E14_419#I know what you're thinking-- have I taken on too much
S30E14_421#by starring and directing a movie
S30E14_423#that I was also tricked into cofinancing?
S30E14_427#No, because this story must be told.
S30E14_432#This is so exciting.
S30E14_435#Krusty's got the passion and vision to make this movie great.
S30E14_440#I have no idea how to make a movie.
S30E14_443#I know nothing.
S30E14_447#All these people are screwed.
S30E14_450#And the crew gift is just a T-shirt.
S30E14_455#Right, right. I, I get it.
S30E14_457#In the tradition of every actor ever,
S30E14_459#- you thought you could direct. - Directing seemed so easy.
S30E14_462#You just hold your hands like this, then bing, bang, boom,
S30E14_465#Annie Leibovitz is taking your portrait
S30E14_467#in a bathtub full of milk.
S30E14_469#Yeah, talk about pressure, though.
S30E14_471#Man, I remember once I was filming a special
S30E14_473#at the Laugh Basement in Tampa...
S30E14_474#This isn't about you.
S30E14_476#You got your ad in for Dollar Doorknob Club.
S30E14_478#Now, let me talk.
S30E14_481#They say in Hollywood, "Nobody knows anything."
S30E14_484#Well, I knew a lot less than that.
S30E14_486#What do you like for the princess's headpiece,
S30E14_488#feathers or scales?
S30E14_490#I don't know, how about scales?
S30E14_492#Oh, well, there goes the whole costume budget.
S30E14_494#Uh, for the crew lunch,
S30E14_496#the grips want their hot dogs boiled,
S30E14_497#but the gaffers want them grilled.
S30E14_500#Either way, I don't got no hot dogs, so, uh, which is it?
S30E14_503#Do you want the space ship doors to open like,
S30E14_506#"Zzztt-zzztt," "Ppswishh" Or "Wahh-wahh"?
S30E14_508#Judd Nelson won't come out of his trailer.
S30E14_510#Christian Slater won't go back into his trailer.
S30E14_513#How many sugars do you want in your coffee?
S30E14_515#Stop asking me things!
S30E14_517#Is this an official break, or are we taking a five?
S30E14_522#Hmm, that poor clown man.
S30E14_525#This movie is his dream, and it's falling apart.
S30E14_528#Yeah, that's Mexico showbiz for you.
S30E14_538#Oh, is nothing on this movie real?
S30E14_541#Um, are you okay?
S30E14_542#Okay?
S30E14_544#I'm a total fraud who can't make a single decision.
S30E14_548#Well, maybe you just need to start with a small one.
S30E14_550#Like, what color should the space monster's blood be,
S30E14_553#orange or green?
S30E14_555#Both. Neither. I don't know!
S30E14_558#Just close your eyes, breathe deeply,
S30E14_561#and envision the blood. What color is it?
S30E14_565#Orange.
S30E14_567#There you go. You decided.
S30E14_570#Of course, orange! I knew I was a genius!
S30E14_573#I did it! I directed a movie!
S30E14_575#Well, it's just one decision.
S30E14_577#Oh, I'm a nothing. A phony-baloney.
S30E14_580#A no-talent. A zilch.
S30E14_583#Just my luck to work for the only insecure person in showbiz.
S30E14_587#You risked everything you have to tell this story.
S30E14_590#It must be special.
S30E14_592#Maybe I can do this with your help.
S30E14_595#How would you like to be assistant to the director?
S30E14_597#Really?
S30E14_599#I need you to help me be decisive.
S30E14_602#No, wait, I don't want that!
S30E14_603#Oh, God, which one?
S30E14_605#- The first, the first. - You're hired.
S30E14_610#Add more dynamite.
S30E14_613#Uh, those explosives are really close to those extras.
S30E14_616#So? We got plenty of them.
S30E14_618#That's why they're called "extras," right?
S30E14_624#You tell that lox to go to acting school
S30E14_627#and work there as a janitor.
S30E14_630#Krusty loves what you're doing.
S30E14_632#Same energy, little quicker.
S30E14_634#Tell him to sod off.
S30E14_636#He says, "You got it, baby."
S30E14_639#It's so much pressure. The whole movie depends on it.
S30E14_642#Tell the story that needs to be told.
S30E14_644#That butt double for the action scene,
S30E14_646#that butt double for the love scene. Let's make art!
S30E14_650#Sorry I'm late,
S30E14_652#but Krusty and I were storyboarding tomorrow's shots.
S30E14_655#Close-up, medium, long, long, 
S30E14_658#establishing, close,
S30E14_661#POV, wide, and then-- get this-- medium.
S30E14_664#You've been so busy with that director, I never see you.
S30E14_668#Krusty needs me. He's under so much pressure.
S30E14_671#You wouldn't believe how much directing dust he's sniffing.
S30E14_673#Everyone's working hard.
S30E14_676#We had to repaint all the sets black and white for a flashback.
S30E14_678#We wouldn't have been able to do it
S30E14_680#if not for all the crew powder.
S30E14_681#Well, it'll all be worth it
S30E14_683#when this movie touches people's hearts,
S30E14_687#as Peabo Bryson sings the theme song over the credits.
S30E14_689#You got Peabo?
S30E14_691#- Well, he hasn't committed. - He's not the only one.
S30E14_694#This was supposed to be a romantic adventure,
S30E14_697#but whenever we have a moment alone, your beeper goes off.
S30E14_701#Why don't we have a romantic adventure right now?
S30E14_703#Oh, yeah, baby.
S30E14_710#Wahh-wahh.
S30E14_717#Where were you?
S30E14_719#I had to watch the dailies without you.
S30E14_723#Greetings. Welcome.
S30E14_726#Greetings. Welcome. Greetings. Welcome. Greetings.
S30E14_729#I've been going back and forth all night. Which is better?
S30E14_732#Did you get one with "Hello"?
S30E14_736#I'm sorry, I was with Homer, my boyfriend.
S30E14_740#Boyfriend? You can't have a boyfriend. I want you!
S30E14_742#Krusty!
S30E14_743#Not like a lady.
S30E14_746#Like a "Mother slash therapist slash rabbi" who xeroxes things.
S30E14_749#Dump the boyfriend.
S30E14_753#I believe in this movie, but I also believe in Homer and Marge.
S30E14_758#Me, I'm Marge.
S30E14_761#Oh, yes, Marge. Marge, I knew that.
S30E14_764#Marge. Marge.
S30E14_768#I'm not going to break up with Homer. He's my soul mate.
S30E14_771#Hmm. You know what? I get it.
S30E14_774#Your life has to come first.
S30E14_777#Yet again, you're the only one who can set me straight.
S30E14_780#- Thank you. - That's all right.
S30E14_782#It's not all right.
S30E14_784#I'm gonna grind that boyfriend down finer
S30E14_787#than this movie's red sand...
S30E14_789#that I now wish was sand-colored.
S30E14_792#Send in my anesthesiologist
S30E14_794#so I can take a nap.
S30E14_796#Dreams or no dreams?
S30E14_798#Surprise me.
S30E14_808#Wow, it's crazy, man, right?
S30E14_810#How narcissism and insecurity go hand in hand?
S30E14_812#I mean, you couldn't function
S30E14_814#because your assistant had a boyfriend.
S30E14_816#Where does that jealousy come from?
S30E14_818#How would I know? I fired my shrink
S30E14_820#after I found out she was seeing other patients. Anyway...
S30E14_823#I made sure the boyfriend
S30E14_825#had all the most dangerous jobs on the set.
S30E14_829#I'm out of breakfast burritos.
S30E14_837#Bring in the stunt dummy.
S30E14_846#Perfect. Let's get one more for safety.
S30E14_851#I'm telling you, your crazy boss is out to get me.
S30E14_854#No, he's not. Krusty loves our relationship.
S30E14_857#Every day, he says it would be a shame
S30E14_860#if something happened to you, then laughs and laughs.
S30E14_863#Then why are they sending me out to the middle of the desert
S30E14_866#to find a lizard for a new scene about a space lizard?
S30E14_869#Hmm, that does sound a little dangerous.
S30E14_871#No, I'm sure it's super safe.
S30E14_874#I'll see you when I get back alive.
S30E14_885#Here, lizard, lizard, lizard.
S30E14_887#Who wants to be famous?
S30E14_888#Look at all those skeletons.
S30E14_890#Mexicans sure love Halloween.
S30E14_895#D'oh! What the...?
S30E14_906#Oh, I'm trapped in a ravine.
S30E14_909#Only one thing to do: wait patiently for death.
S30E14_914#- Dad, wake up! - What?
S30E14_916#Yeah, get up, fat-ass.
S30E14_918#Who the hell are you, talking cactuses?
S30E14_920#We're the kids you're never gonna have
S30E14_922#if you don't you get your lazy butt out of that hole.
S30E14_925#And technically, it's "Cacti."
S30E14_930#Why should I climb out of here and have you?
S30E14_933#Marge spends all her time taking care of that needy clown.
S30E14_936#I thought I was her passion project.
S30E14_938#You know, someday you might appreciate a wife
S30E14_940#who's developed empathy and patience
S30E14_942#for chubby, selfish men.
S30E14_945#Look at that bald guy.
S30E14_948#He's so bald!
S30E14_949#I don't think we'll ever be born.
S30E14_951#Sorry, Maggie.
S30E14_953#Eat my thorns.
S30E14_955#Why, you prickly...!
S30E14_968#A casa. I'm saved.
S30E14_977#The Pain Lords forced me to mine every quarry on this planet,
S30E14_981#but they never imagined I had the Love Gem all along.
S30E14_986#And... cut.
S30E14_989#That was amazing.
S30E14_991#And you remembered all your lines.
S30E14_992#Aw, thanks...
S30E14_995#Marge.
S30E14_997#You've helped me become what every director should be:
S30E14_1000#an amiable guy who makes everyone suffer
S30E14_1003#through his hellish process.
S30E14_1005#Homer's been kidnapped.
S30E14_1007#There's a note.
S30E14_1012#"We have taken your blubbering coward."
S30E14_1021#"The ransom is $1 million
S30E14_1023#or 100 Los Angeles Raiders season tickets."
S30E14_1027#"Go, Raiders."
S30E14_1029#Oh, geez, I'm sorry, everyone.
S30E14_1031#We don't have the cash to ransom that kid,
S30E14_1033#but I think I know what he'd want:
S30E14_1035#a special thanks in the closing credits
S30E14_1038#right before which kind of film stock we used.
S30E14_1040#Back to work.
S30E14_1043#No. This crew looks after its own.
S30E14_1045#We're gonna save Homer,
S30E14_1048#and I don't care how much golden time they have to pay us.
S30E14_1055#We don't have a million-dollar ransom,
S30E14_1057#but we do have one thing:
S30E14_1059#movie magic.
S30E14_1061#Powder up, everyone.
S30E14_1070#"Ay ay ay," Indeed.
S30E14_1074#Give us back our P.A.!
S30E14_1077#The Americans, they have weapons from the future.
S30E14_1083#These weapons from the future, they are not real.
S30E14_1097#Stop shooting. Stop shooting. Cut!
S30E14_1099#Okay, that's a five.
S30E14_1103#We don't have your million dollars,
S30E14_1105#but we can give you something much more valuable:
S30E14_1108#a Hollywood movie.
S30E14_1110#All we want back is the lowliest member of our crew.
S30E14_1113#We could sell it to the highest bidder at MIFED!
S30E14_1115#You have a deal.
S30E14_1118#No, no! You can't give away my masterwork.
S30E14_1122#"There's a light that shines from star to star,
S30E14_1125#from soul to soul, connecting everyone in the universe."
S30E14_1129#Be the man who believes in those words,
S30E14_1132#and let the light between me and Homer give life to our universe.
S30E14_1139#Gentlemen, the film is yours.
S30E14_1148#You're a good man, Krusty.
S30E14_1150#Only when I'm with you,
S30E14_1152#which is why I never want to see you again.
S30E14_1155#I want that, too.
S30E14_1158#I've done a lot of interviews, man, but wow.
S30E14_1160#I-I am so glad that Byron Allen canceled.
S30E14_1163#And after that, my movie career was kaput.
S30E14_1166#I was sent back to kids TV
S30E14_1169#and never cared about making anything good ever again.
S30E14_1172#Well, folks, you heard it. Who could ever forget it?
S30E14_1176#A heartbreaking story about a selfish man's one selfless act.
S30E14_1179#Do you like hot cashews
S30E14_1180#but don't have the time to heat them up?
S30E14_1183#'ShewBlasters is disrupting the heated nut business.
S30E14_1186#If the 'Shew heats, eat it!
S30E14_1201#Mom! Dad! You guys never told us
S30E14_1204#you worked on a movie together.
S30E14_1205#So that's why you've been wearing
S30E14_1207#that crew jacket all these years.
S30E14_1209#That crazy movie? Oh, man, that was a long time ago.
S30E14_1211#We were just kids.
S30E14_1212#What was it like?
S30E14_1214#Well, working on that movie set
S30E14_1216#turned out to be a lot like our marriage.
S30E14_1219#Long days, stupid fights you don't remember,
S30E14_1222#but damn good breakfasts.
S30E14_1224#A good breakfast can get you through a lot.
S30E14_1227#But what happened to the movie? Did Krusty ever see it?
S30E14_1230#I don't know. I guess we'll never know.
S30E14_1233#The love crystal is whole once more.
S30E14_1236#The prophecy is fulfilled.
S30E14_1252#- What? Why are they laughing? - They think it's a comedy.
S30E14_1257#It was supposed to show how we're all connected.
S30E14_1261#Look around, man. Maybe it did, maybe it did.
S30E14_1264#If you think this is closure, you're nuts.
S30E15_94#You see that, kids?
S30E15_95#It's the kind of car they don't make anymore.
S30E15_97#Windshield that breaks into a thousand glass razor blades.
S30E15_100#Your lap is the cup holder.
S30E15_102#Vinyl seats that can melt your ass.
S30E15_104#God, do I want to drive it.
S30E15_107#Oh... so useless.
S30E15_110#This is the car I've always wanted.
S30E15_113#You'll never have a car this nice.
S30E15_115#You'll never have a girlfriend this cute.
S30E15_117#That's right!
S30E15_119#And you'll never have exhaust this toxic.
S30E15_126#Oh, I need this. I've always needed this.
S30E15_127#Get in, kids, get in.
S30E15_130#Dad, what were you just telling us?
S30E15_132#This is morally wr...
S30E15_136#Pull every knob. Press all the buttons.
S30E15_137#Find out what things do.
S30E15_145#Don't you "Chitty chitty bang bang" Me!
S30E15_153#Ooh, what's this crank for?
S30E15_155#Duh, rolling down the window.
S30E15_157#Hmm. How do I put on the air conditioning?
S30E15_159#Uh, you're doing it.
S30E15_161#Aw, cool. An ashtray.
S30E15_163#A full ashtray!
S30E15_166#Uh-uh-uh! Bad, bad, bad!
S30E15_169#Ah, smooth. Bad, bad.
S30E15_177#Now, to tie them in a bow.
S30E15_182#My husband-- he's doing something incredibly stupid.
S30E15_187#Look at this beautiful color.
S30E15_189#Seafoam. This is what cars used to look like.
S30E15_192#And what the sea used to look like.
S30E15_199#Put this on the list of things we don't tell your mother.
S30E15_202#Including the fact there is a list.
S30E15_205#Aw, it's over.
S30E15_207#Now, to teach you kids a life lesson.
S30E15_209#Moments of pure joy always have consequences.
S30E15_212#We already knew that.
S30E15_214#Yeah. Why do you think we exist?
S30E15_216#Quick! Put on your innocent faces.
S30E15_218#Innocenter... innocenter.
S30E15_221#Uh, yeah, I'm, uh, I'm sorry, you gave me the wrong car.
S30E15_224#The moment I realized, I brought it back immediately.
S30E15_228#You stole my car.
S30E15_231#My precious 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz convertible
S30E15_234#in the original seafoam,
S30E15_236#with the illegal brodie knob.
S30E15_238#Oh, God. Tell me right now you did not touch my brodie knob.
S30E15_241#Absolutely not.
S30E15_243#This is the brodie knob.
S30E15_245#Oh. I was all over that thing.
S30E15_247#You're in big trouble.
S30E15_249#They're gonna charge you with grand theft auto.
S30E15_251#A lousy game but a magnificent law.
S30E15_254#Listen, I'm sorry. Really sorry.
S30E15_256#I just wanted to give my kids a ride,
S30E15_258#show them the house I was born in,
S30E15_260#show them the house I'm gonna die in,
S30E15_262#then drive through a cornfield for kicks.
S30E15_266#I gave you the USS Enterprise,
S30E15_268#and you returned with the Orville!
S30E15_272#I am so sorry. You're absolutely right.
S30E15_274#I'll get it fixed by a pro.
S30E15_276#I'll get you a license plate frame saying
S30E15_278#"My other car is a..."
S30E15_279#insert dumb movie reference.
S30E15_281#Tron Legacy Light-Cycle. Well, okay.
S30E15_285#I suppose I could allow you to-- oh, God!
S30E15_287#No!
S30E15_290#My mint condition copy of Radioactive Man number one!
S30E15_294#This was the comic I always wanted most
S30E15_297#since I was an athletic, popular child.
S30E15_299#Look, you're a nice guy.
S30E15_301#When have you ever seen me be a nice guy?!
S30E15_304#I am pressing charges!
S30E15_309#Is this yours?
S30E15_311#Yes.
S30E15_314#Simpson, get on the bike.
S30E15_316#Put your arms around me.
S30E15_318#Now, head on my shoulder. Yeah... aw, that's nice.
S30E15_321#And don't lean the same way I do
S30E15_322#or we're both dead.
S30E15_324#Uh, by the way, you're under arrest.
S30E15_326#Uh, doesn't the law say I need a helmet, too?
S30E15_329#Another law you're breaking.
S30E15_334#Why are you riding a motorcycle?
S30E15_336#It's not for fun! I got arrested!
S30E15_337#That's worse!
S30E15_341#Your Honor, I'm scared. Okay, I screwed up.
S30E15_344#If you'll permit, may I read a speech in my defense?
S30E15_346#Did your daughter write it?
S30E15_348#Absolutely not.
S30E15_350#Sir, if an opportunity came along
S30E15_352#to give your kids a memory they'll never forget,
S30E15_355#wouldn't you hop in the driver's seat?
S30E15_357#A golden day with their dad.
S30E15_359#What could be more innocent?
S30E15_362#All I know is that as that gas gauge read empty,
S30E15_365#our hearts were full. Full of love.
S30E15_368#Love of what our country does best:

S30E15_386#Yes, you are.

S30E15_469#Comic Book Guy, my husband is really sorry.
S30E15_473#Okay, he screwed up. But he doesn't belong in prison.

S30E15_558#No, no. Sentencing mitigation videos.
S30E15_561#People have had their jail terms reduced,
S30E15_563#or even gotten off death row
S30E15_565#by producing slick video appeals to the judge.
S30E15_569#Finally, a way for rich people to bend the system their way.
S30E15_572#Mr. Burns got off the hook once
S30E15_575#by using a video directed by Guillermo del Toro.
S30E15_579#Hello, I am, uh, film director Guillermo del Toro.
S30E15_583#Uh, when I was a young boy, I fell in love with monsters.
S30E15_586#Frankenstein's monster, King Kong, Son of Kong,
S30E15_589#Nosferatu, Godzilla, Mechagodzilla,
S30E15_591#Godzilla's nephew Godzooky,
S30E15_593#Mothra the caterpillar, Mothra the moth,
S30E15_595#the Blob from The Blob...
S30E15_597#and Godzilla's cousin, Sheldon Godzilla.
S30E15_600#Lesser known but equally horrifying.
S30E15_602#Monsters, yes. But they are capable of love.
S30E15_605#Which brings us to Montgomery Burns.
S30E15_608#Oh, hello.
S30E15_609#Did someone mention me?
S30E15_611#From birth, he was not wanted.
S30E15_616#Then came the real monsters:
S30E15_618#the bullies that hated him just because he was wealthy.
S30E15_621#And maybe he rubbed it in a little.
S30E15_629#But no one knows the real Mr. Burns.
S30E15_644#I love Se?or Burns.
S30E15_645#Who are you?
S30E15_647#He combines the ancient evil of Cthulhu
S30E15_649#with the trim physique of Slender Man.
S30E15_652#Se?or Burns demonstrates that in all so-called monsters
S30E15_655#beats a heart. Thank you for listening.
S30E15_656#And thank you, Georgia Film Commission,
S30E15_658#for the 22% discount.
S30E15_660#I'll see you wherever free people congregate.
S30E15_661#Like the Yale Club.
S30E15_670#Wow. Maybe I've been all wrong about evil.
S30E15_673#Once again, Mr. Del Toro stripped away the darkness
S30E15_676#and found beauty at its core.
S30E15_678#Like that fish-snuggling movie.
S30E15_681#Excuse me.
S30E15_685#Ah... you told me you've never been to Missouri.
S30E15_688#You're right, honey. Hollywood can solve anything.
S30E15_690#Except its own lack of creativity and diversity.
S30E15_692#Now, how do we make this thing?
S30E15_694#I think we should use a videographer.
S30E15_696#There's one left in town.
S30E15_700#I will do anything for your wedding video.
S30E15_702#Color, black and white, 
S30E15_704#or Polaroid Swinger, cha cha cha.
S30E15_707#I gotta warn you, my camera hand is shaky
S30E15_709#because I have a major vitamin E deficiency.
S30E15_713#No problemo. It works fine if you just
S30E15_715#nod your head like this...
S30E15_722#You know, we could just do it ourselves.
S30E15_725#Yeah. Those are the words that are killing my profession.
S30E15_729#Now you say nice things about me.
S30E15_730#So what is it you're looking for?
S30E15_732#Words or something? Uh, human words?
S30E15_736#Okay, uh, Homer Simpson, uh, well, real family man.
S30E15_739#Yeah. Always brings his kids into the bar.
S30E15_741#Not one of them aristocrats who gets all bent out of shape
S30E15_743#when there's a mouse in his beer.
S30E15_745#Hey, Moe. I need you to file a serial number off a wheelchair.
S30E15_747#Cut!
S30E15_749#Homer Simpson? How can I put this?
S30E15_752#Ah, we've never had an employee get rehired so many times.
S30E15_756#Homer Simpson has two children enrolled in our school.
S30E15_759#That's all I'm comfortable saying.
S30E15_763#All right, let's see what you got.
S30E15_764#I had to edit a little.
S30E15_768#Homer Simpson. Family man.
S30E15_769#Happy. Aristocrat.
S30E15_771#Too. Cool. Comfortable.
S30E15_773#Homer is a... grace to the family.
S30E15_775#He is an ape...le father.
S30E15_777#I warned Marge... marry him.
S30E15_780#That's the best you can do? I'm screwed!
S30E15_783#Not while I can use Final Cut Pro.
S30E15_786#We'll start from scratch.
S30E15_788#Using the only two things people still believe in:
S30E15_790#babies and dogs.
S30E15_793#Sorry, Snowball, cats are polarizing.
S30E15_798#Please...
S30E15_800#just give us something we can use.
S30E15_807#We're ready.
S30E15_809#Oh, now the dog won't cooperate.
S30E15_812#There's a trick that always works with Kevin James.
S30E15_822#*I think I'll color this man father*
S30E15_824#He's a guy who gets off at 5:00
S30E15_826#and comes directly home to be with his kids.
S30E15_830#*Said I'm gonna color him father*
S30E15_832#*Color him father*
S30E15_835#He's incredibly generous to his friends and neighbors.
S30E15_840#In his spare time, he loves PTA meetings.
S30E15_843#Helping with the Cub Scouts.
S30E15_845#Or just going to the movies.
S30E15_848#This is Maggie, our baby.
S30E15_850#And she understands what's going on.
S30E15_853#She's never said a word, but I get the feeling
S30E15_856#she wants to say something now.
S30E15_859#Nee... Da... dy.
S30E15_861#What a man.
S30E15_865#And now we pray.
S30E15_866#Bless us, O Lord,
S30E15_867#for this bountiful feast...
S30E15_869#Not that prayer.
S30E15_871#I must say, I am impressed.
S30E15_873#So, unless the prosecution has a rebuttal, I'm inclined to...
S30E15_876#Not... so... fast.
S30E15_878#Do you have a video, too?
S30E15_880#No, that would be pretentious.
S30E15_882#- Very well, then. - I have a speech.
S30E15_886#Comic book sales is a very fragile field.
S30E15_889#Kids hate to read, the stores smell like farts
S30E15_891#and bubble gum...
S30E15_895#Then the things I cherish most-- my father's car,
S30E15_899#my precious, precious comic, and most important,
S30E15_902#my dignity-- were taken from me.
S30E15_905#I'm just your ordinary small businessman.
S30E15_908#Never took anything from anyone.
S30E15_911#But I did dare to think I would be treated with respect.
S30E15_915#I have so many fictional heroes, Your Honor.
S30E15_919#For once, please give me a real one.
S30E15_925#Best. Courtroom speech. Ever.
S30E15_927#Yes!
S30E15_929#I will render my sentence tomorrow.
S30E15_931#I thank you. Good night.
S30E15_932#Boom.
S30E15_933#Wait, wait, wait. Do you want to go to a movie?
S30E15_935#I'll go to a movie with you, Judge.
S30E15_937#You won't be available.
S30E15_944#Dad, the computer says...
S30E15_946#That computer has brought me nothing but trouble
S30E15_948#and sports scores while I'm at church!
S30E15_951#A store in Ogdenville just put up
S30E15_953#the same Radioactive Man comic that we destroyed
S30E15_955#in perfect condition.
S30E15_957#It's my last hope at freedom.
S30E15_960#I mean, how much could an old comic cost?
S30E15_983#- Are you done? - No.
S30E15_999#You can't be closed. It's Tuesday at 4:30!
S30E15_1003#Do you not see the "closed" sign written in Wakandan?
S30E15_1007#And I wasted high school learning German.
S30E15_1010#Was fur eine Schande!
S30E15_1013#Well, German is Earth's closest language to Klingon.
S30E15_1015#Come on in.
S30E15_1036#What do you want?
S30E15_1037#I'm extremely busy.
S30E15_1045#I want to talk to you.
S30E15_1047#I see we have reached the epilogue of our little drama.
S30E15_1051#No, not the epilogue. Still plot. Still plot!
S30E15_1054#Look, I know we've had our differences,
S30E15_1056#but we can still be friends.
S30E15_1058#Like when Superman teamed up with Lex Luthor.
S30E15_1061#That was an imaginary story written by Harlan Ellison
S30E15_1064#because he wanted to get fired.
S30E15_1066#Well, maybe this will tickle your ponytail.
S30E15_1071#The Ogdenville copy! It lives!
S30E15_1074#Am I forgiven?
S30E15_1075#I'm afraid not. No.
S30E15_1077#I don't have a choice. The grudge is still inside me.
S30E15_1080#Which is also the name of a low-budget Roger Corman movie.
S30E15_1083#Oh! What does it take?
S30E15_1085#How to explain what I am feeling.
S30E15_1087#Uh...look around. What do you see?
S30E15_1090#Uh... A bunch of stuff that other people threw out?
S30E15_1093#Like a mirror, you see everything
S30E15_1095#but understand nothing. Get out.
S30E15_1097#Let's go.
S30E15_1099#Oh, my God! Oh!
S30E15_1101#Is that a season one Welcome Back, Kotter key chain?
S30E15_1105#It is! The proof...
S30E15_1107#a John Travolta who is happy to be there!
S30E15_1110#How did you get this?
S30E15_1116#Did I ever tell you about my Uncle Max?
S30E15_1117#He was the halfback in the family.
S30E15_1119#If you gave him a sandwich, you got half back.
S30E15_1124#This is for you, son.
S30E15_1126#Don't say I never gave you nothing.
S30E15_1128#Are you gonna give me anything else?
S30E15_1129#Nope. One thing.
S30E15_1133#Homer, when you look at your precious totem there,
S30E15_1135#how does it make you feel?
S30E15_1137#I never thought of it before.
S30E15_1138#I touch it all the time.
S30E15_1140#I feel unhappy if I don't have it.
S30E15_1142#Sometimes I dream about it.
S30E15_1144#I think I love it!
S30E15_1146#Well put. Now understand this.
S30E15_1151#That is how you made me feel!
S30E15_1155#Now you see.
S30E15_1157#And you may consider the charges dropped.
S30E15_1159#Let us shake hands, drink rice wine,
S30E15_1161#and enjoy Swedish Fish candy.
S30E15_1163#Are you saying I'm off the hook?
S30E15_1165#Yes. In fact, you may be surprised,
S30E15_1167#but you are now my best friend.
S30E15_1169#So I'm not going to prison?
S30E15_1171#No, you are going to Comic-Con with me.
S30E15_1174#Let me see, let me see.
S30E15_1176#Dad, just say yes.
S30E15_1180#Is prison still an option?
S30E15_1182#No. Not until you hold down Harrison Ford
S30E15_1185#while I clip off his fingernails.
S30E15_1186#Let's get to it.
S30E15_1196#- What's this? - Mitigation video.
S30E15_1199#When I first met Bart,
S30E15_1201#I was just a nerdy kid with glasses.
S30E15_1203#But now this blue-haired butterfly's
S30E15_1206#ready to emerge from his pupa!
S30E15_1209#Simpson, you think this is helping you?
S30E15_1213#Skinner's a jerk. Skinner's a jerk.
S30E15_1215#Skinner's a jerk. Skinner's a jerk.
S30E15_1217#Skinner's a jerk.
S30E15_1219#Skinner's a jerk.
S30E15_1220#Skinner's a jerk.
S30E16_79#I guess we have no choice.
S30E16_81#Here's the number for the poison control center,
S30E16_84#the allergy hotline,
S30E16_86#and, if the kids misbehave,
S30E16_87#Papa John's Pizza.
S30E16_89#Don't worry, Mrs. Simpson.
S30E16_91#We'll take great care of your kids.
S30E16_92#"We"?
S30E16_93#Uh, me and God.
S30E16_94#Okay, then.
S30E16_96#We'll see you soon.
S30E16_105#Want to watch videos of pythons swallowing stuff?
S30E16_108#Uh, can't we watch something with kittens?
S30E16_110#Oh, there's kittens in there.
S30E16_117#This is pointless.
S30E16_119#We learned all the new dangerous drugs last year:
S30E16_121#sprack, zup, borzo, and crystal bam.
S30E16_124#I hear they're mixing bam with zup.
S30E16_126#Interesting.
S30E16_128#Bam and zup.
S30E16_130#This seminar's already paying for itself.
S30E16_133#Homer Simpson, are you watching football
S30E16_135#through your pants pocket?
S30E16_138#But do you know how much love is lost between these teams?
S30E16_140#None!
S30E16_142#Turn it off!
S30E16_144#This bag of concentrated death
S30E16_147#is what the kids today call "Blizzard."
S30E16_150#Allow me to demonstrate.
S30E16_152#On Skin-ner!
S30E16_154#Superintendent, I-I must protest.
S30E16_156#I'm an educational professional who...
S30E16_159#That's a good boy.
S30E16_160#Take your medicine.
S30E16_163#Oh, let's get out of here.
S30E16_166#I guess we can watch the PowerPoint presentation
S30E16_168#in bed tonight.
S30E16_170#Oh, that sounds magical.
S30E16_172#Just don't be conspicuous.
S30E16_176#Ooh, it's Lenny.
S30E16_178#Homer, I found my birth mom!
S30E16_180#Her name is Cheryl, and she wants nothing to do with...
S30E16_185#A wedding expo!
S30E16_188#Marge, there is no way I'd ever be interested in--
S30E16_190#Is there a girl in that cake?
S30E16_191#No, just cake.
S30E16_194#Oh... that is so sexy.
S30E16_195#After you, Marge.
S30E16_197#Ooh, a wedding expo!
S30E16_200#It's like going to a thousand weddings at once.
S30E16_204#Sneaking in will be the most romantic thing we've ever done.
S30E16_207#More than our real wedding?
S30E16_209#A thousand times more.
S30E16_211#I was pregnant, and you had a fever of 103.
S30E16_214#103.4.
S30E16_217#Aw, you remembered.
S30E16_231#It's so beautiful.
S30E16_235#Even the prenups are gorgeous.
S30E16_243#Your bride will look radiant
S30E16_245#next to these hideous bridesmaids dresses
S30E16_247#made in colors known to scare seagulls.
S30E16_249#Oh, so beautiful!
S30E16_251#Come back here, you.
S30E16_253#You've got 12 more drugs to test.
S30E16_256#I both see and am God.
S30E16_262#Who will protect me when you die?
S30E16_265#Nothing's gonna happen to...
S30E16_268#Does this house have a mixer?
S30E16_270#We could make face cookies.
S30E16_273#Aw! You're gonna make such a good dad.
S30E16_279#I feel like a walk.
S30E16_280#You want to take a walk?
S30E16_283#I feel glued to my seat for reasons I don't understand.
S30E16_285#It's all over, sweetheart.
S30E16_287#The curse is broken.
S30E16_289#Grandma will take care of you from now o...
S30E16_294#Come on!
S30E16_300#Let's see if we can both fit in Homer's underwear.
S30E16_303#This is very sobering.
S30E16_305#Why did we think this would be cool?
S30E16_307#What are you kids doing out so late?
S30E16_309#Babysitter party at our house.
S30E16_311#Why don't you come inside for a mug of cocoa?
S30E16_313#Coco-nut, that is,
S30E16_315#to fill your belly with much-needed potassium.
S30E16_317#Grins, people.
S30E16_318#Thanks.
S30E16_319#Potassi-yum.
S30E16_321#This was a great idea.
S30E16_323#It's like all the fun of a wedding
S30E16_325#without the boredom of a wedding!
S30E16_327#And who are you two?
S30E16_329#Um, why, we're...
S30E16_330#wedding planners!
S30E16_332#Yes, and we're wondering about your products.
S30E16_335#For our clients.
S30E16_338#Well, the Toast Master is an AI-powered microphone
S30E16_341#that guarantees your best man's toast
S30E16_343#will be heartwarming and tasteful,
S30E16_346#no matter how drunk or passive-aggressive he is.
S30E16_349#Ooh. Give it a try, Homie.
S30E16_351#Oh, I couldn't.
S30E16_353#Pretend one of my sisters is getting married.
S30E16_355#That hairy-legged ashtray?
S30E16_356#Give me the mic.
S30E16_358#When I heard a guy was marrying Selma,
S30E16_361#- I thought, That poor... - Genius.
S30E16_363#- ...must be... - Fully sighted.
S30E16_364#- ...and... - Not marrying her
S30E16_365#to harvest her organs.
S30E16_368#Thank God. The Heffernans.
S30E16_370#Oh, right. That's me.
S30E16_371#D.R. Heffernan.
S30E16_373#That's "Doctor." 
S30E16_375#Right. Dr. D.R. Heffernan.
S30E16_377#The keynote speech is in two minutes.
S30E16_379#What's a keynote speech?
S30E16_382#Imagine Dr. Heffernan asking me what a keynote speech is.
S30E16_384#This way.
S30E16_386#Finally, things are looking up
S30E16_388#for the person I'm pretending to be.
S30E16_392#And the number one new wedding trend is...
S30E16_395#True love!
S30E16_397#True love! True love!
S30E16_400#Buy our book if we have one.
S30E16_402#I'm starting to think that's not Dr. Heffernan.
S30E16_409#What a...
S30E16_412#perfect night.
S30E16_414#You wait here while I go...
S30E16_416#pay the babysitter.
S30E16_420#I'm not paying you!
S30E16_421#Get out of my house!
S30E16_424#Later.
S30E16_426#And now, my lady, to the boudoir,
S30E16_428#which I believe is somewhere near the bedroom.
S30E16_435#Have I picked you up yet?
S30E16_436#I can't te-- Oh!
S30E16_438#You're so light!
S30E16_443#Perfect end to...
S30E16_445#perfect night!
S30E16_447#Voulez-vous coucher avec...
S30E16_452#What the?!
S30E16_458#I guess we should stop listening now.
S30E16_460#No one's making you stay.
S30E16_466#Marge, I'm afraid your days of walking are over.
S30E16_468#Oh, my God!
S30E16_470#For about 36 hours.
S30E16_472#By then, this mild ankle sprain should be good as new.
S30E16_474#It's my fault.
S30E16_477#Homie wouldn't have dropped me if I hadn't put on a few pounds.
S30E16_480#Nonsense. It's not your fault you're married to a...
S30E16_482#this.
S30E16_486#And it was such a good date night.
S30E16_489#Well, now it's a hernia morning.
S30E16_491#See, you've got a tear in your abdominal wall
S30E16_493#and a section of your intestine has pushed through.
S30E16_495#Aren't you going to chuckle?
S30E16_497#An inguinal hernia is no laughing matter.
S30E16_500#"Inguinal."
S30E16_502#Will I need surgery?
S30E16_503#Possibly. But don't be alarmed.

S30E16_510#A little more.
S30E16_512#Little more.
S30E16_514#Little more...
S30E16_516#No, those are the wipers!
S30E16_518#Oh, you just called OnStar.
S30E16_520#Now, look, you two, you're not kids anymore.
S30E16_522#Listen to your body. It'll tell you what to do.
S30E16_526#OnStar operator.
S30E16_527#What is your emergency?
S30E16_529#Every comedian I thought is funny
S30E16_531#is dead.
S30E16_533#The Itchy and Scratchy Show!

S30E16_541#"Irritability,

S30E16_547#Blah, blah, blah.
S30E16_550#"Do not mix with alcohol"?
S30E16_551#Fine, I'll drink it separately.
S30E16_553#Boy, get me a beer.
S30E16_559#Huh? What are you doing?
S30E16_560#Helping you get better.
S30E16_561#I was watching Animal Planet,
S30E16_563#and they said, if it can't reach its own food,
S30E16_565#the hippo dies.
S30E16_569#Bart, honey, your father and I need you
S30E16_572#to be a little more grown-up.
S30E16_573#Can you do that?
S30E16_575#I bet you can.
S30E16_576#You got it, Mom.
S30E16_583#Honey, I signed us up for physical therapy this afternoon.
S30E16_586#They sound terrific.
S30E16_587#Even booking the appointment,
S30E16_589#they told me, "Great job."
S30E16_590#Absolutely.
S30E16_592#I want to get better.
S30E16_593#I really do.
S30E16_594#I know you do.
S30E16_596#We'll start tomorrow.
S30E16_599#I would caution against physical therapy.
S30E16_602#Guys like us don't look good in shorts.
S30E16_607#Oh, why is it never hair growth?
S30E16_610#It's me, your hernia.
S30E16_613#Homer, your doctor told you to listen to your body.
S30E16_615#And I am telling you,
S30E16_617#just take it easy.
S30E16_618#Are you sure?
S30E16_620#I just promised Marge.
S30E16_622#Take it from your hernia.
S30E16_628#Oh, you've got this, Marge!
S30E16_630#Now, focus on your co-ah.
S30E16_632#I guess I've been neglecting my key-aah.
S30E16_634#Is it this?
S30E16_636#No. All I can say is, if you have a muscle
S30E16_639#and you know what it does, then that is not the co-ah.
S30E16_642#Oh, the core.
S30E16_643#Right, that's what I said-- co-ah.
S30E16_645#Now, what sports are we gettin' you ready for, Marge?
S30E16_648#Rollerblading? Uh, Muay Thai?
S30E16_650#No, nothing like that.
S30E16_652#I only have to be in good enough shape
S30E16_655#to take care of an immobile 240-pound man.
S30E16_658#Ah, so Homer isn't coming, eh?
S30E16_660#You know, I could go to him at work.
S30E16_662#Oh, he's got enough stress at work.
S30E16_667#All right, well, we'll get you into something.
S30E16_669#Uh, mountain biking? Free bouldering?
S30E16_672#I got it. Marge, we are going to get you kitesurfing!
S30E16_675#Kitesurfing?
S30E16_677#I could do that with Homie.
S30E16_686#You know what?
S30E16_687#I'm not letting Homer drag me down this time.
S30E16_690#Yes, I want to learn kitesurfing.
S30E16_693#*Let's go kitesurfing now*
S30E16_694#*Middle-aged ladies learning how*
S30E16_696#*Come on Kitesurf-ari with me*
S30E16_698#Kitesurfing's a simple sport.
S30E16_700#All you need is the wind and the waves.
S30E16_702#And a spreader-bar, bindings,
S30E16_704#impact vest, chicken loop,
S30E16_706#donkey stick, squirrel clip, and, of course, parking pass.
S30E16_709#Yeah, ruining people's day at the beach.
S30E16_712#We are worse than sand in a hot dog, eh, Lou?
S30E16_715#You know there's a double murder downtown?
S30E16_717#Well, now it's a triple, 'cause you just killed my day.
S30E16_720#Keep the kite swooping, Marge.
S30E16_721#Follow the timing of my pecs.
S30E16_723#Left, right, left, right,
S30E16_725#left, left, right...
S30E16_727#Ah. Don't look me in the eyes, Marge.
S30E16_728#My pecs are down here.
S30E16_730#There you are.
S30E16_732#Left, right, left, left, right...
S30E16_735#So, Mom is kitesurfing
S30E16_738#while Dad is eating three desserts.
S30E16_740#Oh, your grandma and I had our differences,
S30E16_744#but we stopped arguing when she disappeared for three decades.
S30E16_750#Oh, it's so nice to get an evening out just with you.
S30E16_752#Can I get you a baby chair?
S30E16_754#No? You're good?
S30E16_755#Homer's-a talking to nobody.
S30E16_757#The Cat Lady is eating with cats.
S30E16_760#Ralph is in-a the lobster tank?
S30E16_762#I'm expensive.
S30E16_764#Homer, you're doing great.
S30E16_766#Look at those guys-- eating half portions,
S30E16_769#trying to stay fit.
S30E16_771#They're just setting themselves up to meet my buddies
S30E16_773#Torn ACL and Pinched Nerve.
S30E16_776#Now, you, you're smart.
S30E16_778#The most strenuous thing you're gonna do
S30E16_780#is fart "The Star Spangled Banner."
S30E16_783#Mm, that's got a difficult range.
S30E16_785#Is there an easier anthem?
S30E16_788#Hey, the riskiest thing we're gonna do is have lasagna.
S30E16_792#We just had lasagna.
S30E16_793#Have it again!
S30E16_794#Nobody's gonna stop you.
S30E16_796#I love you.
S30E16_800#Who are you?
S30E16_802#Cirrhosis. What's it to ya?
S30E16_809#Homer, I'm going to the beach.
S30E16_811#I packed lunch for two if you want to come.
S30E16_812#Oh, the beach.
S30E16_814#Sure. Let's get sunstroke,
S30E16_817#a hyperextended tendon,
S30E16_820#and wrap it up by getting decapitated by a Frisbee.
S30E16_822#Hard pass.
S30E16_824#Sorry, Marge. Hard pass.
S30E16_827#It's been so long since you made a move on me.
S30E16_829#Or any move.
S30E16_832#Um, how about if I drone you a kiss?
S30E16_839#Hurry up, Marge.
S30E16_841#We're gonna catch big air all morning,
S30E16_844#sleep all afternoon, then boil a sheep for breakfast.
S30E16_846#I'm still on New Zealand time.
S30E16_848#Been here 12 years but can't shake it.
S30E16_851#Please, Homer, you're my husband.
S30E16_854#Get up and live.
S30E16_856#Sorry, Marge. I got to go with my gut.
S30E16_863#If you don't come after me, there's a big problem.
S30E16_867#The drone doesn't count.
S30E16_875#Can you watch the kids this afternoon?
S30E16_878#Sorry, Marge.
S30E16_879#Hernia.
S30E16_880#We make quite a team.
S30E16_882#Who are you talking to?
S30E16_884#Hey, I do not have voices in my head.
S30E16_886#They're in my crotch.
S30E16_890#Just call my sisters to watch the kids.
S30E16_895#Let's drop him in the woods
S30E16_897#and see if he can find his way back.
S30E16_904#Our parents are drifting apart.
S30E16_906#And as much as I don't enjoy doing this,
S30E16_909#I need the advice of the only couple we know
S30E16_911#that seems to like each other.
S30E16_913#I'm stuck with you.
S30E16_915#Relationships are simple, really.
S30E16_917#Like, if Shauna's best friend Tiffany comes on to me,
S30E16_920#I make out with Shauna,
S30E16_922#but I pretend it's her friend.
S30E16_926#Tiffany. Oh, yeah.
S30E16_930#Guys. Guys, guys, guys. Let's focus!
S30E16_931#Focus.
S30E16_933#Please give me something useful.
S30E16_935#Okay. Your parents have just got to find
S30E16_938#something they both like doing.
S30E16_940#Like, I like laughing at losers.
S30E16_942#And I make losers happen.
S30E16_950#Common interests!
S30E16_951#Of course.
S30E16_956#Back now to live coverage
S30E16_958#of Little XII college golf on ESPN-D3-2,
S30E16_961#your second home for Division III sports.
S30E16_964#Dad, can you drive us down to the beach?
S30E16_966#I have a school project on... sea turtles.
S30E16_969#Don't listen to them.
S30E16_971#You can see me?!
S30E16_974#It's always the babies.
S30E16_981#Hey. Where are the turtles?
S30E16_983#There are no turtles, Homer. It's a trick.
S30E16_985#These kids are trying to help you, 'cause they love you.
S30E16_988#So there never were turtles?
S30E16_991#No turtles!
S30E16_993#I'm starting to think there were no turtles.
S30E16_996#Marge.
S30E16_999#She looks so beautiful.
S30E16_1001#I've been such a fool.
S30E16_1003#And you forgot to get a parking pass. Heh.
S30E16_1006#Our work is done, Lou.
S30E16_1017#I'll never let myself go like that!
S30E16_1020#I'm-a comin', Marge!
S30E16_1023#Ew! Gross!
S30E16_1027#Homer, you're making me mad.
S30E16_1029#And if there's one thing you don't want to aggravate,
S30E16_1031#it's a hernia!
S30E16_1038#I'm Marge's husband, Homer.
S30E16_1039#Homer! Good-o!
S30E16_1041#Would you like me to rehab you at work?
S30E16_1044#I could come right to you. Same price.
S30E16_1046#Maybe. But now I need your biggest, fastest kite.
S30E16_1048#- The Widdamaka? - What?
S30E16_1050#Can you say that without an accent?
S30E16_1052#- The Widowmaker. -Oh! That's scary!
S30E16_1054#- Back to the accent! - The Widdamaka.
S30E16_1055#I'll take it!
S30E16_1057#When I got married, I took a vow:
S30E16_1059#"Something, something, something
S30E16_1061#till death something."
S30E16_1068#Homer! Rooster your gimbal!
S30E16_1069#Rooster your gimbal!
S30E16_1071#What does that mean?!
S30E16_1072#Pull the rope!
S30E16_1075#The other rope.
S30E16_1079#Homie!
S30E16_1081#You came for me!
S30E16_1083#And I'll never leave you.
S30E16_1085#Except right now when the wind blows me
S30E16_1087#God knows where....
S30E16_1089#They're headed for a wind farm!
S30E16_1107#Well, Mother, looks like we caught
S30E16_1109#a couple more kiteboarders.
S30E16_1111#I'll get the big ladder.
S30E16_1114#I'll tell the hospital their power's gonna be down for a while.
S30E16_1119#Strong woman, I love you.
S30E16_1122#And I love you.
S30E16_1125#And never again will I listen to a doctor.
S30E16_1128#Wait, that's not the takeaway.
S30E16_1130#Takeaway? That's a good idea!
S30E16_1132#Yello? Pizza Palace?
S30E16_1134#Can I get a Henry the Eight-Inch Pizza with extra meat?
S30E16_1137#And a side of chocolate cheesy bread?
S30E16_1138#No such thing.
S30E16_1140#Can you make it anyways?
S30E16_1145#Chief, I gotta make dinner for my kids. 
S30E16_1147#Could you please  tell me what this is about?
S30E16_1149#Like most physical therapists in America,
S30E16_1152#this man is actually a Russian spy.
S30E16_1155#Nigel is a spy?
S30E16_1157#Dimitri Nigelovonovitch.
S30E16_1159#Did you ever wonder why he was so interested
S30E16_1161#in seeing your husband at work?
S30E16_1163#I thought it was close to his house.
S30E16_1166#Didn't you ever ask yourself how a beach bum like him
S30E16_1170#could afford a top-of-the-line 2007 Saturn SUV
S30E16_1172#with a full spare tire?
S30E16_1174#I guess I didn't want to know.
S30E16_1177#Just thank God, thank God your husband is entrapping him now.
S30E16_1183#Homer, I just need a few pictures of...
S30E16_1185#the co-ah.
S30E16_1187#- The what? - Goo-ah.
S30E16_1189#- The car? - Goo-ah.
S30E16_1192#Like a crow? Caw?
S30E16_1194#Co-ahr-car?
S30E16_1196#Damn it. Show me your reactor core.
S30E16_1199#All units, move in!
S30E17_53#Yep, tough love. I'm his father, not his best friend.
S30E17_56#He'll hate me now, but someday he'll say wonderful things
S30E17_60#about me to people on airplanes who just want to go to sleep.
S30E17_62#That young man will...
S30E17_64#How did you punish him?
S30E17_66#Well, I sat the boy down, looked him straight in the eye,
S30E17_69#and bought him a top-of-the-line computer gaming rig.
S30E17_72#- You what? - I get it. You bribed him.
S30E17_75#Stay out of this. I did not bribe him.
S30E17_77#I addicted him to something that will numb his spirit
S30E17_79#until he's no longer our responsibility.
S30E17_82#Well, it has been pretty peaceful around here.
S30E17_85#Kill! Die! Die! Get wrecked, newbs!
S30E17_91#This is General Splattin'. Do you copy?
S30E17_92#Copy.
S30E17_92#Copy.
S30E17_94#Jinx. You owe me a Coke.
S30E17_96#I'll never be able to pay that bet.
S30E17_98#Focus, Nelson, focus.
S30E17_100#Kite the enemy into a gank. Squeeze it...
S30E17_101#on three... two...
S30E17_103#Gg!
S30E17_104#That means "Good game."
S30E17_107#It's how the other team lets you know... they surrender!
S30E17_112#Now I hit control-six to defile their corpses.
S30E17_114#Haw-haw! Haw-haw!
S30E17_115#Haw-haw!
S30E17_124#Civilized annihilation.
S30E17_126#Marge, the boy just may be learning some life skills.
S30E17_129#Mom, do you agree with this?
S30E17_131#I guess so. Your father is showing an interest in Bart,
S30E17_133#which is good.
S30E17_135#Well, if that's how things work,
S30E17_137#then I'm gonna behave badly, too.
S30E17_140#That's great!
S30E17_141#Sure you are.
S30E17_144#I'll show you! I'm gonna... tear up my homework.
S30E17_149#I'm really gonna do this. Here I go.

S30E17_176#Skunk sprayed him good.
S30E17_179#Oh, my God, he's playing with himself!
S30E17_181#On that game.
S30E17_184#He's playing that game in the shower?
S30E17_185#We have to stop this right now.
S30E17_187#Homer, take care of your son.
S30E17_189#Make him quit. Geez.
S30E17_191#Sorry, boy, I have to put my foot down.
S30E17_192#I can't quit now.
S30E17_194#My team's about to compete in a tournament.
S30E17_195#I can't let them down.
S30E17_197#Well, team building is important.
S30E17_200#All right, let yourself go, and your partner will support you.
S30E17_206#Damn you, Homer!
S30E17_208#Please, Dad, can I play in this one last tournament?
S30E17_210#Sorry, boy, you're through.
S30E17_212#First prize is a thousand bucks.
S30E17_214#You get paid to play video games?
S30E17_215#A thousand bucks.
S30E17_217#- They actually pay you? - Yes.
S30E17_218#In dollars?
S30E17_219#Yes.
S30E17_220#To play a video game?
S30E17_221#That's right.
S30E17_222#They pay you in cash?
S30E17_224#Yes, yes, yes!
S30E17_225#How much?
S30E17_225#A thousand!
S30E17_227#All right. Do not tell your mom,
S30E17_229#but I'm gonna say yes, one last tournament.
S30E17_230#Oh, thank you, Dad.
S30E17_232#Just one thing-- they actually pay you?
S30E17_233#Yes!
S30E17_236#A thousand dollars to play video games?
S30E17_241#Group up. Time to put these suckers away.
S30E17_242#Oh, yeah, show me some Gs,
S30E17_244#Odgenville.
S30E17_250#We win! And it's all because I let them do it.
S30E17_253#Now, apparently, the Evergreen Terrors have won,
S30E17_256#uh, this thing I don't understand at all,
S30E17_259#but which gave the school new basketball nets.

S30E17_269#Let go, Seymour.
S30E17_270#I'm telling myself to.
S30E17_272#I've never held this much money in my hand all at once.
S30E17_274#Let me just, uh...
S30E17_275#look at it.
S30E17_280#$100 bill, autographed by Lawrence Summers.
S30E17_283#Such a carefree signature, before the Great Recession.
S30E17_288#Here you go, $200 each. Mm!
S30E17_292#Okay, team, take a break and meet up for practice in 30.
S30E17_294#My dad said we could all go to Krusty Burger.
S30E17_296#Is he giving us a discount?
S30E17_298#No, he just said we could go.
S30E17_300#It will be nice to have some kids in there again
S30E17_302#after what the monkey did during that birthday party.
S30E17_306#Whatever. Just meet in 30.
S30E17_308#Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You know what, kids?
S30E17_309#I'm gonna blow your minds
S30E17_311#with a little bit of hard-earned advice:
S30E17_313#Quit while you're ahead.
S30E17_316#We can't quit. There's so many more tournaments.

S30E17_320#This isn't like baseball or politics
S30E17_321#where you can make real money.
S30E17_323#You only have one childhood, kids. Enjoy it.
S30E17_326#Okay, but because we came in first
S30E17_329#we qualified for a tournament where we could win $500,000.
S30E17_332#Childhood's over. It's time for work.
S30E17_345#That's right, sweetie.
S30E17_347#I'm going to make your brother a champion.
S30E17_351#Knock off that racket!
S30E17_352#You're gonna defy Mom?
S30E17_354#Sit on my knee, boy.
S30E17_355#I think I'm too old.
S30E17_357#You're never too old to sit on Daddy's knee.
S30E17_359#Ow, my knee! Get off! Get off!
S30E17_363#Son, here's a life lesson:
S30E17_365#I don't directly tell your mother anything bad.
S30E17_367#I secretly make her a part of everything she's against.
S30E17_370#That's why I spent your winnings on her.
S30E17_373#Honey, I got you a present.
S30E17_376#An espresso pod machine,
S30E17_378#like the one I made fun of at the Hibberts'.
S30E17_381#Because you wanted it yourself. Let me pod you, my dear.
S30E17_384#Ooh! What's the occasion?
S30E17_386#The occasion is that I haven't been
S30E17_389#as good of a father as I should.
S30E17_392#Yes. Well, no, uh...
S30E17_393#Don't argue. It's true.
S30E17_395#I need to get more involved in Bart's life,
S30E17_397#so I've decided to be his coach.
S30E17_399#That's wonderful. Coaching what?
S30E17_401#Oh, I haven't landed on it yet.
S30E17_404#Football, chess, maybe even a silly video game.
S30E17_406#It doesn't matter. Have some coffee.
S30E17_408#I love how it doesn't fill the cup.
S30E17_411#Very European. Mmm.
S30E17_413#-It's a video game. -What?
S30E17_417#I guess if you're spending time together, what's the harm?
S30E17_420#Look who's a dad. Look who's a dad.
S30E17_422#I knew you'd be cool with it.
S30E17_424#Also, I hired a video game expert to tutor Bart.
S30E17_426#His name is The Detonator.
S30E17_431#"I can't make conversation unless it's about gaming."
S30E17_434#Do you want to come in?
S30E17_437#Do you want to go where they're playing the game?
S30E17_439#Thank you, ma'am.
S30E17_441#Homer, I've watched Bart play--
S30E17_442#here, on his Twitch feed,
S30E17_444#and his HitForm, InstaBox, Gibtrack, Buzuba,
S30E17_446#and YergaPunch streams.
S30E17_448#Hmm, the only word I recognized was Gibtrack.
S30E17_451#I think Bart has what it takes to be top ten.
S30E17_453#-Players? In the country? -Bigger.
S30E17_455#-The galaxy? -Smaller.
S30E17_456#-World? -Yes.
S30E17_460#Kids, make sure you're in a chair that spins.
S30E17_462#You're all gonna get a lesson from The Detonator.
S30E17_463#Let's jump into a battle.
S30E17_465#To start, Bart and Nelson, we'll put you up front,
S30E17_467#and we'll back you up with Sophie and Milhouse.
S30E17_469#Booyah!
S30E17_471#Notice my finger is clicking the mouse with a light,
S30E17_472#quick stroke to
S30E17_473#limit joint fatigue and tracking error.
S30E17_475#I'm clicking like the mouse button is hot.
S30E17_476#Not too hot;
S30E17_478#like the top of a toaster after an underdone bagel.
S30E17_480#Okay, now I'm using that quick mouse stroke here and here,
S30E17_483#which is how, Bart, you should drop diamonite mines
S30E17_485#to surround their spawn points.
S30E17_487#Milhouse, make sure you're in position
S30E17_488#to respond to enemy aggression.
S30E17_490#Sophie, when they make their move, go in and engage.
S30E17_494#My dad's been engaged 20 times. I know what to do.
S30E17_496#Okay, now we're entering the mid-game,
S30E17_498#where it's important to keep focusing on major objectives
S30E17_500#and control the map.
S30E17_502#Okay, Homer, you watch the screen while I take a quick A.P.
S30E17_504#What's an A.P.?
S30E17_505#It's a gamer abbreviation for "A pee."
S30E17_508#Nerd lingo. Saves so much time.
S30E17_510#All right, I'm walking through the kitchen,
S30E17_512#blue-haired woman is feeding a baby.
S30E17_513#I'm making eye contact.
S30E17_515#Your shoes have lace holes but no laces.
S30E17_518#Linoleum, linoleum.
S30E17_520#Strafing into the bathroom, gonna go into defuel mode.
S30E17_522#Lifting seat with shoe.
S30E17_524#Going over the belt saves time.
S30E17_526#Shaking, flushing and hand washing are the real time killers.
S30E17_529#Once I cut those out, my lag time went way down.
S30E17_531#Okay, these Water Mages have fuel tanks on their backs,
S30E17_534#so you can't hit them with standard spells,
S30E17_536#but if I equip this staff that lets me cast lava quadballs...
S30E17_540#I mistimed it. Oh, God, I mistimed. They killed me.
S30E17_543#Do you mind if I dance over your corpse?
S30E17_545#I'd be mad if you didn't.
S30E17_548#- It's over for me. - Why?
S30E17_550#I just lost my gaming edge. Right there, just now.
S30E17_552#Been in the zone for years, and now I'm not.
S30E17_555#Time in a bottle, man, time in a bottle.
S30E17_557#But you were gonna mold my team into winners,
S30E17_558#and I was gonna live through them.
S30E17_560#Just yesterday, I turned 19.
S30E17_562#Made it longer than most in this crazy biz.
S30E17_564#Anyway, I'm gonna go work for my uncle. He owns a tile store.
S30E17_567#It'll be a good life. Good enough.
S30E17_569#Sucks to be old.
S30E17_571#I didn't cry at my grandpa's funeral,
S30E17_574#mostly because he was racist, but I'm crying now.
S30E17_590#He taught us all he could. Now it's up to me.
S30E17_593#- Do we get uniforms? - No. No uniforms.
S30E17_596#You're a ragtag bunch without any sponsors
S30E17_598#that'll have everyone rooting for you.
S30E17_600#Are you kids ready to turn this thing you like
S30E17_603#into something that will consume every waking minute?
S30E17_606#- Maybe! - Hit the music!
S30E17_618#Kids, you need to practice 10,000 hours to get great.
S30E17_620#Are you sure?
S30E17_621#It's how long Malcolm Gladwell needed to think it up.
S30E17_625#*Bart is a champion*
S30E17_627#*Which makes me a champion*
S30E17_630#- *I am the champion of the...*  - Homer.
S30E17_633#*World.*   Yes, Marge?
S30E17_636#I've noticed how much time you've been spending with Bart.
S30E17_638#I know what's coming.
S30E17_640#I'm riding him too hard, and you want me to pull back.
S30E17_642#- No. - What the...?
S30E17_644#Honestly, I worry so much about that boy,
S30E17_647#I'm afraid he's going to wind up in jail.
S30E17_650#Marge, his kill count is 98%.
S30E17_653#Guys like that don't end up in jail.
S30E17_655#And I promise you, I will coach him as hard as I can.
S30E17_658#But will you also coach him to be a good man?
S30E17_661#That's Flanders' job.
S30E17_663#I'm on it.
S30E17_675#Homer Simpson? Go right in.
S30E17_678#Welcome, Homer. Welcome to the club of dads
S30E17_681#who live through their glorious athletic children.
S30E17_684#Tiger Woods' father.
S30E17_687#Hey, I have a name, although I've forgotten it.
S30E17_689#Okay, so it's 5:00 in the morning.
S30E17_691#My son is four.
S30E17_692#He hits the boards and starts bleeding.
S30E17_694#His elbow's sticking out of his skin.
S30E17_697#Yeah, I got my camera, and he says,
S30E17_699#"Daddy, what are you doing?"
S30E17_702#I said, "I'm filming the last time you are ever gonna cry."
S30E17_707#- Oh, that is great. - Ha. Excellent coaching.
S30E17_709#Really? It's not mean?
S30E17_711#Homer, we're obsessive sports fathers,
S30E17_713#so we're gonna teach you how to motivate
S30E17_715#- the only way we know how. - Don't hit me.
S30E17_718#Oh, we're gonna hit you, all right.
S30E17_719#With a song.
S30E17_723#*Never wanted Roland-Garros*
S30E17_725#*Never made it to the show*
S30E17_727#*Never won the Stanley Cup trophy*
S30E17_729#*For five years in a row*
S30E17_732#*There's nothing in our lives that we ever really did*
S30E17_735#*Except made our child a superstar*
S30E17_738#*And lived through our kid*
S30E17_740#*Live, live through your kid*
S30E17_742#*Wake him up at 5:00 *
S30E17_744#*Live, live through your kid*
S30E17_747#*It's the only way to feel alive*
S30E17_750#*Strap him to a hockey stick*
S30E17_752#*While he is still asleep in bed*
S30E17_754#*Build a scary dragon to fire tennis balls*
S30E17_756#*Right at his head*
S30E17_758#*There's no training that's too torturous*
S30E17_761#*Or cruel to play this game*
S30E17_763#*Because when they win at Pebble Beach*
S30E17_765#*You share in the fame*
S30E17_768#*Live, live through your kid, homeschooled by his mom*
S30E17_771#*Live, live through your kid*
S30E17_775#*They'll surely come to hate you*
S30E17_777#*But that's later on*
S30E17_780#*There is absolutely nothing like*
S30E17_784#*Living through*
S30E17_788#*Your kid*
S30E17_793#This is still part of the dream, Homer.
S30E17_798#No uniforms?
S30E17_799#I'm rooting for those underdogs.
S30E17_803#Yes, you are, and you don't even know why.
S30E17_806#I just said, it's the no uniforms.
S30E17_810#Not a clue.
S30E17_813#Poke and harness those trolls.
S30E17_815#On it. Nelson, get ready to back me up
S30E17_817#in case their heroes engage on me.
S30E17_818#On my way.
S30E17_820#- It's a trap! - They're ganking me.
S30E17_821#Damn it, they got me.
S30E17_823#Respawning in 30.
S30E17_825#They're control-sixing my corpse.
S30E17_826#We're gonna win.
S30E17_831#It's coming, Gordy.
S30E17_833#Hold on a minute.
S30E17_835#Bart Simpson has not given the "GG."
S30E17_838#And the diamonite mine he planted in the dragon turds
S30E17_841#is exploding now.
S30E17_846#Springfield is going to the world championships
S30E17_850#in Seoul, South Korea, while the Canadian team is out.
S30E17_853#"Out"?
S30E17_854#"Oot."
S30E17_856#Yo, what the...? Oh, come on, what's that all about?
S30E17_858#And I am, too.
S30E17_860#This is the last match I'll announce.
S30E17_862#I'm going to spend my time oil painting,
S30E17_864#but my wife says not in the house.
S30E17_868#Hey, sweetie, what's going on?
S30E17_870#I'm only talking to you now to prove a point.
S30E17_873#You've been spending all your time with Bart,
S30E17_875#and you haven't paid any attention to me at all.
S30E17_878#And I know you're just gonna respond with a,
S30E17_880#"That's nice, honey," and move on. I know it.
S30E17_882#That's nice, honey.
S30E17_884#Bart and I are going to South Korea.
S30E17_887#It'll be great, Lisa. We'll have girls time here.
S30E17_890#Bake cookies, see the movies we want to see.
S30E17_893#Mom, I try to spare you because I don't want you feeling
S30E17_897#thoroughly appropriate guilt for what this family does to me,
S30E17_900#but now one of my dreams is within my grasp.
S30E17_902#See?
S30E17_905#I want to go to South Korea, to the Jogyesa Buddhist monastery,
S30E17_909#because they teach something there so special, so magic,
S30E17_911#it could be life-changing.
S30E17_914#It just never seemed possible, and I had to accept it.
S30E17_917#I'm holding onto a thin rope here,
S30E17_919#because if Bart and Dad go to Seoul and I miss out,
S30E17_922#I'll lose my grip.
S30E17_924#I'm losing it now!
S30E17_926#Hear me, hear me, dear God, someone hear me.
S30E17_929#Help me before it's too late!
S30E17_931#Girls trip to South Korea.
S30E17_933#Oh, thank you, Mom.
S30E17_935#I'm going down to the basement to get my happy diary.
S30E17_937#You do that.
S30E17_950#Pretzels, M&M's, Pringles.
S30E17_953#It's a complete Thanksgiving dinner.
S30E17_955#Pringles are for champions only.
S30E17_956#Milhouse, can I have a word with you?
S30E17_958#Oh, no. This is never, ever good.
S30E17_961#Don't worry. This will be good.
S30E17_963#I lied. This is really bad.
S30E17_965#Son, the rules say that we get to swap in
S30E17_968#one player for this round, and I'm asking you to step down.
S30E17_971#I'm always the one that has to step down.
S30E17_973#That's why I chose you.
S30E17_975#- You've got rejection muscle. - Fine.
S30E17_978#Good boy. You're our Rudy.
S30E17_981#- Rudy got to play. - I didn't say which Rudy.
S30E17_985#Can't you give me a pity job, like scorekeeper?
S30E17_987#Fine, you're scorekeeper.
S30E17_989#I don't want your pity job.
S30E17_992#Dad, I think you need a little more salt in your diet.
S30E17_995#Where are you taking us?
S30E17_1001#You know, I don't want to be here.
S30E17_1003#Shh. We're here.
S30E17_1006#Are you sure these are safe here?
S30E17_1009#No, this whole temple is a scam to collect smelly shoes.
S30E17_1011#I knew it.
S30E17_1013#This is what I was talking about.
S30E17_1015#These are salt mandalas.
S30E17_1017#This will change our lives.
S30E17_1019#Start pouring the salt.
S30E17_1032#That's so beautiful.
S30E17_1034#I finally understand why you had to come here.
S30E17_1037#So how do we get it home?
S30E17_1039#I worry about it in my carry-on.
S30E17_1041#I'm gonna need a lot of glue.
S30E17_1043#- We don't. We destroy it. - What?
S30E17_1046#To prove attachment to any material pursuit is meaningless.
S30E17_1048#I'll start.
S30E17_1052#Mom, you're tidying it.
S30E17_1053#Destroy it.
S30E17_1056#Are you happy now? Because...
S30E17_1059#I am.
S30E17_1061#Yes. You've achieved Zen.
S30E17_1064#Now you just have to do two more.
S30E17_1066#I'm gonna go check on Dad.
S30E17_1070#You have been wasting your talents bowling.
S30E17_1072#You have to destroy it.
S30E17_1074#Never! Never! Never!
S30E17_1076#Damn it!
S30E17_1081#Now do you see it? Do you see the meaninglessness
S30E17_1083#of striving for worldly things?
S30E17_1085#I do.
S30E17_1088#I am going to stop being so driven and ambitious...
S30E17_1091#Don't you laugh, Missy.
S30E17_1093#Amazing Zen.
S30E17_1095#He's like the reincarnation of the Buddha.
S30E17_1100#It is the Buddha.
S30E17_1102#Great. Now I feel guilty I stole his shoes.
S30E17_1118#We're in the late game,
S30E17_1120#and the Evergreen Terrors have a narrow lead
S30E17_1122#against the Brazilian Blowouts, but...
S30E17_1124#where is Coach Homer Simpson?
S30E17_1130#Competition is meaningless.
S30E17_1143#To strive is to fail.
S30E17_1145#Out of nowhere, the mind comes forth.
S30E17_1148#And a third thing.
S30E17_1153#Time for the lava quadball.
S30E17_1159#We're gonna win. Dad's crazy coaching worked.
S30E17_1162#If I win, I'll be the most famous girl gamer of all time.
S30E17_1165#Also, if I lose.
S30E17_1169#So beautiful. Must destroy.
S30E17_1178#No! Not now.
S30E17_1186#The match is canceled. No refunds.
S30E17_1187#Send in the riot police.
S30E17_1222#Uh, welcome to our 19-hour-and-45-minute flight
S30E17_1224#from Seoul, South Korea to Springfield.
S30E17_1227#One brief note: Our in-flight entertainment system
S30E17_1229#is not working at all.
S30E17_1231#Have a great flight, folks.
S30E17_1233#Also, we're out of almonds.
S30E17_1235#Zen. Remember your Zen.
S30E17_1238#I'm sorry, you're too fat for coach.
S30E17_1240#We'll have to put you in first class.
S30E17_1242#Thanks to Buddha, I win again.
S30E17_1244#Dad, I don't think you've quite grasped the religion.
S30E17_1248#Boo-duh.
S30E17_1265#We don't want you anymore. You blew it.
S30E17_1268#Your son has a chance to be well-adjusted.
S30E17_1270#Yeah, great.
S30E17_1272#Wait, I've got a baby daughter.
S30E17_1275#Maybe she's good at beach volleyball.
S30E17_1276#How old is she?
S30E17_1277#- One. - Too late.
S30E18_74#- Are there any plans... - For another Krusty movie?
S30E18_77#We're waiting for a story that needs to be told.
S30E18_81#Once we see that, we'll copy it and call it a parody.
S30E18_84#Oy. Does anyone have a question
S30E18_86#that hasn't been asked a thousand times?
S30E18_90#I have the worst fans in the world.
S30E18_93#Now we've got a big surprise
S30E18_95#for the best fans in the world!
S30E18_98#We're making some big changes
S30E18_100#to your favorite cartoon.
S30E18_104#It's different.
S30E18_107#It's an all-female reboot of Itchy & Scratchy!
S30E18_110#Oh, my God!
S30E18_113#Pretty enlightened, eh, kids? We here at the Krusty Show
S30E18_116#really care about gender diversity.
S30E18_119#Ask anyone: our lawyers, our attorneys, anyone.
S30E18_122#A girl Itchy & Scratchy?
S30E18_124#No, no, no, this can't be.
S30E18_126#They've ruined my childhood.
S30E18_128#Your childhood is currently happening.
S30E18_130#That's how I know.
S30E18_131#It doesn't make any sense.
S30E18_133#In real life, Itchy and Scratchy are dudes.
S30E18_136#Girl mice don't have the upper body strength
S30E18_138#to wield a chain saw.
S30E18_140#Is truth dead?
S30E18_144#Ah, you boys are leaving me for video games anyway.
S30E18_147#Zap, zap, zap, you'll all die alone.
S30E18_150#Girl power is where it's at.
S30E18_152#That movie where Superman was a chick
S30E18_154#made a megillah of shekels. Am I right, ladies?
S30E18_159#See? Girls like my pandering.
S30E18_161#Remember this if there's ever a gender war.
S30E18_163#Oh, this is the worst change
S30E18_166#Krusty's ever made to the show,
S30E18_168#even worse than Sideshow Leonard Cohen.
S30E18_171#When girl Itchy & Scratchy comes on,
S30E18_172#we should totally hate-watch it.
S30E18_174#No, everybody come over to my house,
S30E18_176#and we'll turn off the TV the second
S30E18_178#that girl cartoon comes on.
S30E18_180#We'll hate-not-watch it.
S30E18_182#Yeah! Hate-not-watch!
S30E18_184#Yeah, that won't not show 'em.
S30E18_188#I never really thought about Itchy and Scratchy
S30E18_191#as male or female, but it is cool that they're girls now.
S30E18_194#I always thought they were a married couple,
S30E18_196#and that's why they fought so much.
S30E18_199#Mom, they're different species.
S30E18_201#I don't know what to be liberal about anymore.
S30E18_205#I am so pumped to hate-not-watch Itchy & Scratchy.
S30E18_208#I've not popped the popcorn, the lights are not turned down.
S30E18_211#Perfect.
S30E18_213#Listen, son, I'm proud that you're starting to hate things,
S30E18_215#but take it slow.
S30E18_217#If you use up all your hate when you're young,
S30E18_220#one day you'll be an old man who likes things that suck.
S30E18_222#Tonight, cabbage.
S30E18_224#It is a lovely shade of gray,
S30E18_227#and just look at the wrinkling.
S30E18_231#All I'm saying is, if they ever make a female Mr. Magoo,
S30E18_234#I will lose it, I will just lose it!
S30E18_237#Hey-hey, kids!
S30E18_239#It's time to tickle your funny bones
S30E18_241#and your Equal Employment Opportunity Commission bones
S30E18_244#by presenting the all-new, all-female
S30E18_247#Itchy & Scratchy!
S30E18_250#Now to sit in silence till it's over.
S30E18_252#Blindfolds on, gentlemen.
S30E18_257#This is Lisa Simpson,
S30E18_259#recording my reaction to this historic moment
S30E18_262#in cartoon women's history.
S30E18_270#The Itchy & Scratchy
S30E18_271#Girls!
S30E18_275#May I?
S30E18_285#*I got my ticket for the long way 'round*
S30E18_289#*Two bottle o' whiskey for the way*
S30E18_291#*And I sure would like*
S30E18_293#*Some sweet company*
S30E18_295#*And I'm leaving tomorrow*
S30E18_296#*What do you say*
S30E18_299#*When I'm gone, when I'm gone*
S30E18_303#*You're gonna miss me when I'm gone*
S30E18_306#*You're gonna miss me by my hair, you're gonna miss me*
S30E18_309#Ha-ha! I knew you couldn't resist watching.
S30E18_313#And guess what, you laughed! It was funny.
S30E18_315#I-I wasn't laughing.
S30E18_317#I-I was crying a-and burping!
S30E18_323#And... open.
S30E18_324#We did it.
S30E18_326#We prejudged something without giving it a chance.
S30E18_329#I am so proud of us.
S30E18_332#Like Bart Simpson would ever watch a girl Itchy & Scratchy.
S30E18_335#Never gonna happen.
S30E18_339#That little liar. If only people could know
S30E18_342#that Bart laughed even harder than I did...
S30E18_346#All right, you soda-squirting hypocrite,
S30E18_349#I know exactly what to do with this video.
S30E18_359#Welcome to Josh.0,
S30E18_361#the show for people who want to look at the Internet
S30E18_363#but don't have a computer or a phone.
S30E18_366#You know what bugs me about old guys at the gym?
S30E18_369#They always forget to wipe down the machine.
S30E18_373#He means the blood.
S30E18_376#Now, this boy says he hates all-girl Itchy & Scratchy,
S30E18_379#but then this happened...
S30E18_383#Bart, you got to see this!
S30E18_385#Some old guy at a gym got hit by a boat!
S30E18_388#Also, now everyone knows you're the world's biggest hypocrite.
S30E18_395#You said you weren't gonna watch it,
S30E18_397#and then you did and you loved it!
S30E18_401#Then you got busted and I called you in here and laughed at you!
S30E18_405#And I'm still doing it!
S30E18_408#Look at you.
S30E18_410#What a jerk.
S30E18_418#Well, Bart, how does it feel to be trolled, memed, giffed,
S30E18_422#and, dare I say, pwned?
S30E18_424#How do you know those words?
S30E18_426#I read about them in Parade magazine.
S30E18_428#Big deal, I was exposed as a liar on the Internet.
S30E18_431#I've got so much cred built up, nothing can take me down.
S30E18_434#You betrayed us, Bart.
S30E18_437#And worse, you betrayed your own wang.
S30E18_440#You know what? Yes, I laughed at a cartoon.
S30E18_442#Why? Because it was funny.
S30E18_444#So what if Itchy and Scratchy are girls?
S30E18_446#I laughed, and you can't take back the laugh.
S30E18_449#Girls aren't funny.
S30E18_451#They're hot or moms.
S30E18_452#Or both.
S30E18_454#Girls stole Itchy and Scratchy.
S30E18_456#What are they gonna take next, our body spray?
S30E18_459#Our puka shell necklaces?
S30E18_461#-Yeah! -Lame!
S30E18_464#Girls get everything: bigger, softer baseballs,
S30E18_467#chick flicks, two-piece bathing suits,
S30E18_470#and on House Hunters International,
S30E18_472#they always choose the house that she wants.
S30E18_475#He's right. The wife gets the beach view,
S30E18_477#but it's always a longer commute for the husband.
S30E18_480#-You know, you're right. -Oh, yeah.
S30E18_481#You guys see what's happening?
S30E18_483#You're listening to Milhouse!
S30E18_485#So? Maybe we are.
S30E18_488#They are listening to me.
S30E18_491#The next thing I say must be perfectly chosen
S30E18_494#to show I am worthy of leadership.
S30E18_496#Get him!
S30E18_520#Sixth graders. Tweens.
S30E18_523#What are you doing in the girl's room, Seat Soaker?
S30E18_525#No, no, I didn't mean to come in here.
S30E18_527#I need sanctuary.
S30E18_530#Hey, you guys have a candy machine? No fair.
S30E18_532#Spin him till he barfs.
S30E18_536#I'm full of hummus and milk!
S30E18_543#Pink spray paint?
S30E18_545#Give that back. That's for Skinner's office.
S30E18_548#You tell anyone about this, you're canceled.
S30E18_551#Charlie Rose canceled.
S30E18_552#No, no, no, you can trust me.
S30E18_554#I'm not just any fourth grader.
S30E18_559#Whoa, this dude's El Barto.
S30E18_562#Huh, I always thought it was that fifth grader, Eloise Barto.
S30E18_565#Yeah, sometimes I get her e-mail.
S30E18_567#You know, if you fill up a leaf blower with paint,
S30E18_569#you can coat Skinner's whole office.
S30E18_571#-Duh. -Double duh.
S30E18_574#Where are we gonna get a leaf blower?
S30E18_576#Willie's shack.
S30E18_581#Whoa, homemade prank masks.
S30E18_584#The knit is on.
S30E18_589#This'll teach Skinner to ban sandals.
S30E18_592#Oh, he will not silence our toes.
S30E18_594#Hurry, Skinner's almost back
S30E18_596#from his lunchtime dog-walking job.
S30E18_604#I will not negotiate with terrorists.
S30E18_606#I'll just give in. Sandals unbanned.
S30E18_612#Ladies, that was smooth, Barbie smooth.
S30E18_614#So smooth.
S30E18_616#Hey, why are you still here, truck-nuts?
S30E18_619#Whoa, is this your hideout?
S30E18_621#It's the old Home Ec classroom,
S30E18_622#where they would brainwash girls
S30E18_624#into being good little housewives,
S30E18_626#but now it's our war room.
S30E18_628#Also, we cook here,
S30E18_630#we do a little bit of sewing.
S30E18_631#Stop telling him things!
S30E18_633#Cooties be damned, you girls are badass
S30E18_635#and your pranks are next level.
S30E18_637#Take a seat and learn something.
S30E18_639#We don't do "Pranks,"
S30E18_641#we drop awareness bombs.
S30E18_644#Our protest crew is called Bossy Riot.
S30E18_647#We're pushing back against the pushback,
S30E18_649#starting with this school.
S30E18_651#Look at this his-tory book.
S30E18_654#Cool shades.
S30E18_659#That is textbook textbook shredding.
S30E18_662#Now do you see what we're doing here?
S30E18_663#I think I do.
S30E18_666#You're sticking it to the man, but this time, the man is men.
S30E18_670#Look, you got to let me join your gang.
S30E18_672#You know, if we're really serious about gender equality,
S30E18_674#it's only right that a boy be our servant.
S30E18_678#Okay, No-varies, you're in, if you pass this test...
S30E18_682#Steal Skinner's cell phone.
S30E18_684#Work or personal?
S30E18_686#- Skinner! - Seymour!
S30E18_689#Welcome to girlhood.
S30E18_696#Gentlemen, our way of life -is under attack.
S30E18_698#Hear, hear!
S30E18_700#Society is trying to erase boys.
S30E18_704#They give us drugs that make us do girly things,
S30E18_706#like pay attention.
S30E18_708#They're putting drugs in our medication?
S30E18_711#We need to band together.
S30E18_713#Like a sorority, but for dudes.
S30E18_716#I give you the Boys Rights Association.
S30E18_718#Bra! 
S30E18_720#b-r-a.
S30E18_722#Right now, we're just training BRAs.
S30E18_724#But soon, we'll be the strongest,
S30E18_726#most supportive BRAs anyone has ever seen.
S30E18_730#We are BRAs! We are BRAs!
S30E18_734#Our son has one, two...
S30E18_736#...eight friends.
S30E18_739#They're more than just friends, he's-he's the leader.
S30E18_743#I'm feeling this wave of relief,
S30E18_746#not worrying about my son's social life.
S30E18_749#I can stop being a mother and start being a... a woman.
S30E18_753#Say it. Say it again.
S30E18_756#Our son has friends.
S30E18_789#This is why I sit.
S30E18_806#Springfield,
S30E18_807#a town living in fear,
S30E18_810#as masked pranksters calling themselves "Bossy Riot,"
S30E18_813#spread their terrifying message of female empowerment.
S30E18_815#The latest victim of this "Gal Qaeda," 
S30E18_819#Our once-proud symbol of the portly pastry-purveying patriarchy.
S30E18_821#"Lard Lady"?
S30E18_824#But a donut is the ultimate symbol of masculinity.
S30E18_827#The only lead police have as to the identity of Bossy Riot
S30E18_830#is this security camera footage.
S30E18_834#Moe and his bats.
S30E18_838#Bossy Riot is so cool.
S30E18_840#We need fearless female activists
S30E18_842#to fight back against misogyny and man-spreading.
S30E18_846#Well, whoever they are, they are the coolest badasses
S30E18_849#this town has ever seen, whoever they are.
S30E18_853#Ooh, Bart winked at me.
S30E18_855#I must be in on a joke.
S30E18_862#Bart, are you in Bossy Riot?
S30E18_865#- No way. - Ah, good.
S30E18_868#Because if you were fighting for women's rights,
S30E18_870#it would destroy my entire vision of the universe.
S30E18_873#Actually, I totally am.
S30E18_878#You can't be an activist for women's rights?
S30E18_881#You don't know anything about the feminist cause.
S30E18_884#Sure I do. Chicks get a raw deal.
S30E18_886#I'm a little fuzzy on the deets, but take my word for it.
S30E18_889#It's all about the deets. You're not a girl.
S30E18_891#You just want to spray-paint
S30E18_893#the world and watch it drip.
S30E18_895#You've never been called shrill just because you speak up.
S30E18_899#And-and girls' clothing has no pockets,
S30E18_902#while yours are lousy with pockets!
S30E18_904#This is good stuff, I got to write it down.
S30E18_912#This is someone else's war,
S30E18_915#and you, y-you're just a mercenary.
S30E18_918#Mercenaries are cool, like Boba Fett.
S30E18_921#Oh, yeah, Boba Fett, great character.
S30E18_924#Boba Fett's badass. He wears a jetpack and a cape.
S30E18_927#Pick a lane, weirdo.
S30E18_929#Why does every discussion about feminism
S30E18_931#turn into an argument about Star Wars?
S30E18_934#If Boba Fett's such a great bounty hunter,
S30E18_936#why is his armor all banged up?
S30E18_939#It's a look, like distressed denim.
S30E18_942#You shouldn't be part of a protest
S30E18_944#if you don't care about the cause.
S30E18_946#Well, you care. Why don't you come with?
S30E18_948#Maybe I will.
S30E18_950#Great. Bring black gloves and no ID.
S30E18_952#You've been Tasered before, right?
S30E18_954#It only hurts until you pass out.
S30E18_956#I'm excited; I want to, I do, but...
S30E18_958#there's a part of me that's scared,
S30E18_961#and that part is my body and my head.
S30E18_963#It's okay, I get it.
S30E18_965#There's nothing wrong with being all talk.
S30E18_967#Us feminists need cheerleaders, too.
S30E18_972#So, what's up, my fellow Ruthless Bader Ginsburgs?
S30E18_975#What's on the a-gender for the evening?
S30E18_978#Your friends in the so-called "Boys Rights Association"
S30E18_981#have been protesting The Krusty Show.
S30E18_983#I told you not to light the toys yet.
S30E18_986#I didn't, they just burst into flames.
S30E18_989#Krusty caved. He said he'd never show
S30E18_992#another all-girl Itchy & Scratchy ever again.
S30E18_995#So we're gonna destroy the master tapes
S30E18_998#of every Itchy & Scratchy.
S30E18_1000#Wait, what? No.
S30E18_1002#I love those cartoons.
S30E18_1003#I can't let you do it.
S30E18_1005#Oh, you can't "let" us?
S30E18_1011#Don't have a lady cow.
S30E18_1013#All cows are ladies.
S30E18_1022#That thing you said about me being all talk?
S30E18_1025#Well, I have prepared two comebacks,
S30E18_1028#and I will now give you both.
S30E18_1031#Those girls are gonna destroy every Itchy & Scratchy, forever!
S30E18_1037#Hey, hey, boys and boys!
S30E18_1038#Well, congratulations,
S30E18_1041#I'm never gonna air the girl Itchy & Scratchy again.
S30E18_1045#You hit me where it hurts the most: right in the sponsors.
S30E18_1048#Buy 'em all.
S30E18_1055#We're too late.
S30E18_1060#They're going to destroy the tapes on live TV.
S30E18_1063#Let's get him out of those bras and go.
S30E18_1066#Uh, no, you can leave me like this. I'm good.
S30E18_1069#We are Bossy Riot,
S30E18_1071#and we're gonna drop all the original Itchy & Scratchys
S30E18_1074#into a pool of nail polish remover.
S30E18_1082#That's crazy. We have those backed up a thousand times.
S30E18_1084#Right, Howard?
S30E18_1087#What do you do?!
S30E18_1089#Don't do it. Those shows are funny.
S30E18_1091#Mice killing cats, guts everywhere.
S30E18_1094#It doesn't matter if it's boy guts or girl guts.
S30E18_1096#Guts are guts.
S30E18_1098#See, the thing about comedy is...
S30E18_1100#Bart, stop mansplaining!
S30E18_1102#No, no, no, no, if I keep talking,
S30E18_1104#they'll get it eventually.
S30E18_1118#The fumes are burning my eyes.
S30E18_1125#Look, they're crying, on live TV.
S30E18_1128#Glitterize their tears.
S30E18_1131#Mama!
S30E18_1148#Don't worry, sir, your brothers are united
S30E18_1151#in blaming this on you.
S30E18_1160#Hey, hey! Come back here!
S30E18_1163#You there, sweet innocent girls,
S30E18_1166#did you see three crazed man-haters run through here?
S30E18_1169#Gee, Officer, they went that way.
S30E18_1172#Thanks, princess. Thank you.
S30E18_1174#Wait a second.
S30E18_1176#Do any of you babysit?
S30E18_1179#Great. Be at my house Saturday at 7:00.
S30E18_1181#And if Ralph asks you to give him a bath,
S30E18_1184#do not give him a bath.
S30E18_1186#So I guess I'm not in the group anymore.
S30E18_1189#You were never in the group.
S30E18_1191#We just kept you around for fingerprints and DNA.
S30E18_1194#But making those boys cry was hardcore.
S30E18_1197#You, uh, ever think about wearing the yarn?
S30E18_1200#Me? Join you?
S30E18_1202#Can I do it? Can I push my beliefs further
S30E18_1205#than they've ever gone?
S30E18_1207#Well, let us know.
S30E18_1211#Mask me.
S30E20_101#*I've got spurs that jingle, jangle, jing...*
S30E20_106#My spur's stuck in my eye!
S30E20_107#Carl, you're back in.
S30E20_109#Well, only with Lenny's blessing.
S30E20_111#-You don't have it. -I'm doing it anyway.
S30E20_114#Okay, Marge, this is your big song number.
S30E20_117#You're Ado Annie, the girl who cain't say no.
S30E20_120#Now, do you have any qualms about playing this part?
S30E20_124#-No. -Wrong, wrong! You cain't say no.
S30E20_126#Now, where's my handsome Curly?
S30E20_128#Right here.
S30E20_130#Now, this I can work with.
S30E20_132#Okay, Maggie,
S30E20_134#what shall we do while Mommy rehearses?
S30E20_135#The dog track is closed.
S30E20_137#You can come visit me!
S30E20_138#I didn't hear that.
S30E20_140#Hmm, what shall we do?
S30E20_144#Why is this place so popular?
S30E20_146#Do they serve booze? Is it a baby fight club?
S30E20_148#Is there a big-screen TV?
S30E20_150#Do they serve booze? Are there free doughnuts?
S30E20_152#Meet Batman?
S30E20_153#Do they serve booze?
S30E20_155#We're going to find out.
S30E20_158#Why in the hell is Daddy and Me class packed?
S30E20_161#You'll understand everything when Chloe comes out.
S30E20_164#Quiet, quiet, she's coming.
S30E20_166#I borrowed my granddaughter just for this.
S30E20_168#I said I was taking her to feed the ducks.
S30E20_170#Like I have bread money.
S30E20_171#Hi, dads.
S30E20_173#Who's ready to do the wiggle worm dance?
S30E20_176#I vant to viggle like the vorm, ja.
S30E20_178#*A wiggle worm giggles*
S30E20_180#*And a wiggle worm waggles*
S30E20_183#*Let's all wiggle like the wiggle worm does.*
S30E20_187#Oh, I get it, she's sexy.
S30E20_191#Maggie! How long have you been here?
S30E20_196#Why does this line say "Curt" When I'm talking to Curly?
S30E20_199#No, you see, "Curt" Is in parentheses.
S30E20_202#It tells you how to say the line.
S30E20_204#Obviously lying-- yeah, no, I knew that.
S30E20_207#Impressed noise. You really know your stuff.
S30E20_209#Okay, actors,
S30E20_211#in the words of William Shakespeare,
S30E20_213#find your "X" and shut up.
S30E20_215#Geez, all right, easy.
S30E20_218#All I ask is that you give me the performance
S30E20_221#I have pictured in my head but have not communicated to you.
S30E20_225#Our curtain opens on sun-drenched fields
S30E20_228#of undulating golden corn.
S30E20_233#Stop, stop, stop!
S30E20_235#This set is terrible.
S30E20_238#That corn isn't as high as an elephant's eye.
S30E20_241#Oh, you wanted the corn to be high.
S30E20_244#I have never seen such incompetence and idiocy in a theater.
S30E20_247#You have made me hate you all.
S30E20_250#Excuse my salty language in front of Aunt Eller,
S30E20_253#but why don't you just take a hike?
S30E20_256#Get lost.
S30E20_261#Losing temper, we don't want you here.
S30E20_263#Turns to cast, I saved the play.
S30E20_267#Marge, surely you want me to stay.
S30E20_269#Actually, no.
S30E20_271#For the last time, that's the one word you cain't say.
S30E20_276#This is mine. I brought it from home.
S30E20_277#Now what do we do?
S30E20_279#I learned-a to speak like-a the Oklahoma for this?
S30E20_281#Con-a sarn it.
S30E20_287#Everyone, stop, just stop.
S30E20_289#Chief, no more gunplay.
S30E20_290#But I wanna.
S30E20_295#Just listen to me!
S30E20_298#What if I directed the play?
S30E20_300#Hey, that's a good idea.
S30E20_302#I mean, she directs Homer and the kids
S30E20_303#out of the house every morning.
S30E20_305#And I direct traffic.
S30E20_307#That's a stupid analogy.
S30E20_309#I think Marge makes us all feel good about ourselves.
S30E20_314#Yelling in unison.
S30E20_316#Marge! Marge! Marge! Yay!
S30E20_320#Wait a minute, if this is a real gun, where's the prop?
S30E20_323#Poor Lou.
S30E20_325#All right, you asked for it.
S30E20_327#Uh, wh-wh-who wants Oklahoma Tickets? Front row.
S30E20_330#I can get you three together.
S30E20_339#This is a really complicated show.
S30E20_340#So much gingham.
S30E20_343#We need a show that we can actually pull off in Springfield.
S30E20_346#Small cast, simple sets, and some hip-hop,
S30E20_349#but not real hip-hop.
S30E20_351#Great, but I got to be someplace,
S30E20_353#so, real quick, the best kind of original show
S30E20_355#is one that rips off a big hit.
S30E20_356#What's the biggest hit?
S30E20_357#Hellzapoppin'!
S30E20_359#No, Hamilton by Lin-Manuel Miranda.
S30E20_362#Oh, the guy from In the Heights.
S30E20_364#Now, how did I know that? I'm back!
S30E20_366#All right, who's our Alexander Hamilton?
S30E20_370#That would be me. Thanks to this furnace filter,
S30E20_373#you won't be saying "Burr" Anymore.
S30E20_377#No, our most famous historical figure...
S30E20_381#Jebediah Springfield!
S30E20_383#I'll write a musical biography, warts and all.
S30E20_386#I can't see how that could fail.
S30E20_387#Now I'm in a hurry--
S30E20_389#Maggie and I have a Daddy and Me class.
S30E20_391#Aren't you forgetting something?
S30E20_393#Keys, wallet, I don't think so.
S30E20_395#Oh, sure. I'm happy to take Maggie.
S30E20_397#You sure like that class.
S30E20_400#Oh, uh, some dads just love to be with their little girls.
S30E20_403#- Can I go? - Sorry, no.
S30E20_405#"Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.
S30E20_408#Humpty Dumpty had a great fall."
S30E20_411#Poor little eggy, leaking your goo.
S30E20_415#The Red Queen's not looking, I'll kiss your boo-boo.
S30E20_419#Humpty J. Dumpty, are you eating yourself?
S30E20_422#Maybe.
S30E20_429#Excuse me, excuse me, pal. Take care of your kid.
S30E20_433#I-I'm so sorry. I was just...
S30E20_435#Yeah, I know what you were just.
S30E20_436#Let's see...
S30E20_439#killed a bear, founded a town, died of a beaver bite.
S30E20_441#Lis, you're gonna love it.
S30E20_443#I came up with the perfect opening.
S30E20_444#Okay...
S30E20_447#*Lisa is so stupid, so very, very stupid*
S30E20_450#*So dumb and stupid and smelly, too*
S30E20_453#*She has a real bad temper, a bad, bad temper*
S30E20_456#*And she's smelly, too!*
S30E20_459#You're just motivating me.
S30E20_461#I need to finish this.
S30E20_465#Ah, my Muse.
S30E20_468#Okay, my first day as director.
S30E20_471#So hard to dress for respect.
S30E20_473#No.
S30E20_475#No.
S30E20_477#No.
S30E20_479#Got it.
S30E20_488#Hey-a, buddy, what'll it be?
S30E20_490#Moe, it's me.
S30E20_492#Midge! I thought it was Hillary Clinton.
S30E20_494#Give me a vodka, straight up.
S30E20_496#Are you sure you're not Hillary?
S30E20_499#Our new production will be Bloody Bloody Jebediah,
S30E20_502#a hip-hop musical about our city's founder.
S30E20_505#Is it respectful?
S30E20_507#Not entirely.
S30E20_508#What?!
S30E20_510#Why don't we start by going around the circle
S30E20_512#and saying what parts we're playing.
S30E20_513#I'm Marge, the director.
S30E20_515#Luann, Jebediah's wife.
S30E20_517#Carl, Quarrelsome Settler.
S30E20_519#I got a bone to pick with this part.
S30E20_522#Beautiful, use it. Next.
S30E20_524#Lenny, Mayor of Shelbyville and an ostrich.
S30E20_530#Frink, tech crew. Always crew.
S30E20_534#Hollywood only lets in one Bill Nye in a generation.
S30E20_536#With the nerdy and the hoyvik
S30E20_538#and the reference only I understand.
S30E20_542#And, of course, our incredible star, Sideshow Mel.
S30E20_545#Finally not a sidekick.
S30E20_547#This is my time to shine.
S30E20_550#Your first line is on page 37.
S30E20_551#What?!
S30E20_553#*Yo, Jebediah survived the pox*
S30E20_555#*Never used clocks*
S30E20_556#*Didn't wear socks, *
S30E20_557#*that's what we learned*
S30E20_559#*From examining his docs,*
S30E20_561#*and now the mic drops. *
S30E20_562#Boom, et cetera.
S30E20_564#Krusty, what's wrong?
S30E20_566#It's happened-- the worst possible thing
S30E20_568#that can happen to a performer.
S30E20_570#What do you mean?
S30E20_571#I'm in an article entitled,
S30E20_573#"Where Are They Now?"
S30E20_577#Right above Judd Nelson and New Coke.
S30E20_580#I'll tell you where Judd Nelson is.
S30E20_582#He's on my show tonight.
S30E20_588#Fantastic!
S30E20_589#What's that thing you were doing?
S30E20_592#Oh, uh, local theater. You wouldn't be interested.
S30E20_595#Hey, I'm a performer, an artist,
S30E20_597#which means I'm always interested in money.
S30E20_600#Live theater is the only thing getting ratings these days.
S30E20_602#Who owns the rights?
S30E20_604#A Mrs. Marge Simpson.
S30E20_607#Oh, really? Let's see what kind of bargain
S30E20_610#Mrs. Marge Simpson drives.
S30E20_614#So you'll get 80% of the profits
S30E20_616#while I get foreign distribution rights in Venezuela
S30E20_619#for a window of three weeks.
S30E20_624#So my little show's gonna be on TV live?
S30E20_627#Yep. This is the first time a woman has signed something
S30E20_630#with me where I didn't lose custody of something.
S30E20_632#So where will we stage it?
S30E20_634#Outside, where the lighting is free.
S30E20_636#Ooh, are you sure that's not risky?
S30E20_638#Well, some would say I'm taking a risk
S30E20_641#with an original play and a first-time director,
S30E20_643#but show business is based on risks.
S30E20_646#Risks and comic books. Excuse me.
S30E20_651#So, Marge, are you ready to beg me to come back?
S30E20_655#Actually, Llewellyn, we're doing fine on our own.
S30E20_658#No need to grovel. You don't actually have to say anything.
S30E20_660#Okay, fine, I'll come back.
S30E20_662#No one's asking you to come back.
S30E20_664#You know what? Just for that, I won't come back.
S30E20_667#- Fine. - Please, I'm begging you, take me back.
S30E20_672#All right, but beware,
S30E20_674#hell hath no fury like a director scorned.
S30E20_676#Now, if you'll excuse me,
S30E20_678#I have to sneak my headshot onto the wall.
S30E20_681#And poof.
S30E20_683#You're flushed, Plummer.
S30E20_685#I hired you to bus tables.
S30E20_692#I'm researching a role.
S30E20_701#Now, Mom, before you go into that production meeting,
S30E20_704#I want to pass along a quote from F. Scott Fitzgerald.
S30E20_708#"Great art is the contempt of a great woman for small art."
S30E20_710#He actually said "Man,"
S30E20_712#but he'd have wanted me to change it.
S30E20_714#Didn't he also say, "Show me a hero
S30E20_716#and I'll write you a tragedy"?
S30E20_719#Yes, but he also said,
S30E20_722#"Never confuse a single defeat with a final defeat."
S30E20_724#But didn't he also say,
S30E20_726#"There are no second acts in American lives"?
S30E20_729#Just get in the meeting!
S30E20_731#The bagels are getting hard.
S30E20_738#There's my Jebediah.
S30E20_740#Marge, I'm leaving the show
S30E20_743#to fulfill a lifelong dream--
S30E20_745#playing Prospero in The Tempest.
S30E20_747#You can't quit now.
S30E20_749#We're live in three days.
S30E20_751#We have no understudy.
S30E20_753#And you were gonna bring the edibles for the wrap party.
S30E20_757#Not my problem.
S30E20_759#There's nothing I enjoy more than watching a director
S30E20_762#trying to talk an actor out of leaving for a better part.
S30E20_766#Dramatic twist!
S30E20_772#*a pocketful of rye*
S30E20_775#*Four and 20 blackbirds baked in a pie.*
S30E20_780#Stay in there, you stupid blackbirds!
S30E20_784#Darling, you're supposed to kill the blackbirds
S30E20_786#before you put them in the pie.
S30E20_788#Homie, Homie.
S30E20_792#- Homie. Homie. - Blackbirds! Blackbirds!
S30E20_793#Homie, wake up.
S30E20_795#What are you dreaming about?
S30E20_797#Uh, Daddy and Me class.
S30E20_799#You are a great father.
S30E20_801#Oh, I wish I felt like a great director.
S30E20_804#Fine, if you want me to quit the class, I'll do it.
S30E20_806#Who said anything about quitting?
S30E20_808#I've had enough people quit on me today.
S30E20_811#Marge, anyone who can raise two girls and two boys
S30E20_813#the way you're doing can do anything.
S30E20_815#You're gonna make it.
S30E20_818#I've got a special announcement today.
S30E20_820#You're gonna wear the perfume I bought you?
S30E20_821#Even better.
S30E20_823#Barry's divorce came through,
S30E20_825#so I'm able to leave this class and marry him.
S30E20_827#Come on up, Barry.
S30E20_831#Later, losers.
S30E20_833#Barry's not sitting cross-legged anymore.
S30E20_835#Uh, why him?
S30E20_837#Maybe I have the cutest baby.
S30E20_839#Or maybe the first words I got her to say were
S30E20_841#"I love you, Chloe."
S30E20_843#I love you, Chloe.
S30E20_846#We sang "Wheels on the Bus" Together.
S30E20_848#Well, that's it. Time to...
S30E20_850#Where's the baby I brought?
S30E20_853#Ah, geez. I won't be dating her grandma anymore.
S30E20_858#So I guess we're not doing the class.
S30E20_863#Wait a minute, the part you liked was spending time with me?
S30E20_868#Aw. Well, I'll always dance with you, sweetie.
S30E20_880#Okay, no pressure, but I need to find a new lead
S30E20_883#in the next 15 minutes.
S30E20_884#Preferably a name.
S30E20_886#Is Bumblebee Man available?
S30E20_888#No, he's playing Don Quixote in Man of La Mancha.
S30E20_891#Damn it. Why is this town's theater scene so vibrant?
S30E20_894#I'm here to audition for the part of Macbeth.
S30E20_896#It's not Macbeth.
S30E20_898#-Is it Macduff? -Not Macduff.
S30E20_900#Well, there's no other parts worth playing!
S30E20_902#That's it. We're doomed.
S30E20_904#We'll just have a bake sale.
S30E20_906#Will you serve haggis?
S30E20_907#-No. -I'm out.
S30E20_910#? A pioneer with no fear ?
S30E20_913#? Shooting deer ?
S30E20_915#? On the frontier... ?
S30E20_916#Spotlight that singer.
S30E20_919#? And the crowds all cheer ?
S30E20_922#? Jebediah Springfield ?
S30E20_926#? Found the town right here. ?
S30E20_929#Yes, glavin, it's me,
S30E20_932#with the Gomer Pyle voice and the unexpectedly good singing.
S30E20_935#You've got the part.
S30E20_936#? Thank you. ?
S30E20_937#Save your voice.
S30E20_939#All right, then.
S30E20_944#Marge, as your producer,
S30E20_945#I'm gonna inform you of a problem,
S30E20_947#then blame you if you can't solve it.
S30E20_949#Now what?
S30E20_951#There's one thing a first-time director cannot control.
S30E20_953#Bruce Willis?
S30E20_955#No, the weather.
S30E20_957#-Marge, it's going to rain during the show. -How hard?
S30E20_960#Well, let's just say I hope you liked the movie Waterworld.
S30E20_963#Ambitious, eh, but unsatisfying.
S30E20_966#You might want to consider canceling.
S30E20_968#I don't know much about showbiz, but I know one thing:
S30E20_971#the show must go on.
S30E20_973#Huh? I never heard that before.
S30E20_975#Really? Well, tell me to break a leg.
S30E20_977#Why would I do that? It's violent and cruel.
S30E20_980#Well-- there's no business like show business.
S30E20_982#Nah, nah, now that's not true.
S30E20_984#Most show business companies
S30E20_986#are part of much larger conglomerates.
S30E20_988#Just get the hell out.
S30E20_989#That I've heard before.
S30E20_995#Going live. Break a leg, everyone.
S30E20_997#- What? - Why would you wish that?
S30E20_998#You're mean.
S30E20_1004#*Let me tell you about a mystery*
S30E20_1006#*Of our city's history*
S30E20_1008#*An out-of-towner was our founder*
S30E20_1009#*Despite his latent bigotry*
S30E20_1011#*How did this pioneer domineer*
S30E20_1013#*Persevere, then die right here?*
S30E20_1016#*Before the tire fire, a man named Jebediah*
S30E20_1020#*Made Springfield the new frontier... *
S30E20_1023#Cue camera three.
S30E20_1025#Cue Bart.
S30E20_1031#*That's right, my name is Jebediah Springfield*
S30E20_1035#*There is none to whom I yield*
S30E20_1037#*No king to whom I've kneeled*
S30E20_1040#*Tonight my secrets are revealed*
S30E20_1048#*Jebediah Springfield*
S30E20_1058#*Now, this bear and I are one and the same*
S30E20_1062#*He gave his life so that I could have fame*
S30E20_1064#*Jebediah Springfield.*
S30E20_1067#Cut to commercial.
S30E20_1069#That's a cut to commercial, everyone.
S30E20_1072#John Lithgow?
S30E20_1073#I like to work.
S30E20_1076#- Oh, uh, line, please? - "Grrr."
S30E20_1078#No, you fool, a rescue line.
S30E20_1080#Mom, what do we do?
S30E20_1081#Improvise.
S30E20_1084#Lisa, I need a five-minute rap
S30E20_1085#about the cruelty of the sea
S30E20_1087#and the brave souls who rise above it.
S30E20_1089#No problem. Can I make sly analogies to today's politics?
S30E20_1092#No. You'll date it.
S30E20_1096#*The bullets flew like rain*
S30E20_1097#*As buffalo were slain...*
S30E20_1100#Who wants to change the channel?
S30E20_1102#Eh, either they're all dead or it's a hit.
S30E20_1104#Fifty-fifty.
S30E20_1109#*And now I have a raging fever*
S30E20_1113#*Bitten by a rabid beaver*
S30E20_1116#*I didn't fight for equal rights*
S30E20_1120#*I wish I'd done more for non-whites*
S30E20_1125#*But no more time for Jebediah*
S30E20_1130#*All that's left to do*
S30E20_1133#*Is*
S30E20_1136#*Die-a.*

S30E20_1162#Congratulations.
S30E20_1165#I did it. I directed a popular off-Broadway musical.
S30E20_1169#And I wrote a popular off-Broadway musical.

S27E02_242#Everything tastes better when it's near a road.
S27E02_244#Try a taste.
S27E02_246#Guaranteed to blow your mouth's mind.

S27E02_265#Ooh, charred and moist!
S27E02_268#Like Satan's burps.
S27E02_272#The grill marks are shaped like a honeycomb!
S27E02_275#That's why I call her the Hive.
S27E02_279#She's been passed down through my family for generations.
S27E02_284#They say the Hive's made from a meteor...
S27E02_287#which burned off my great-grandpappy's beard,
S27E02_291#exposing his weak chin to the entire township.
S27E02_296#It was a gift from the heavens.
S27E02_298#The perfect smoker.
S27E02_303#The Hive has never been cooled down,
S27E02_305#never been cleaned.
S27E02_307#Mixing meat, fat and smoke into pure magic.
S27E02_314#Smoked me.
S27E02_316#You look like a man who needs a smoker in his life.
S27E02_319#It just so happens that the Hive
S27E02_321#is available for purchase.
S27E02_324#But why would you give up your most prized possession?
S27E02_327#That'd be like Stephen Hawking selling his talking motorcycle.
S27E02_330#My old lady and I are saving up to live our dream
S27E02_333#of moving further away from our grandchildren.
S27E02_336#But if I don't come home
S27E02_338#with a washing machine, my wife will be so mad.
S27E02_341#Oh, should I do the thing I'm supposed to do
S27E02_343#or the thing everybody knows I'm gonna do?
S27E02_346#You bought a grill?!
S27E02_348#It's not a grill.
S27E02_350#It's a smoker.
S27E02_351#That you can grill on.
S27E02_353#That money was supposed to de-stink our children,
S27E02_356#and instead you bought a... doo-hickey
S27E02_359#to stuff your greedy face.
S27E02_362#Don't worry, Homer.
S27E02_365#Nothing fixes bad times like good food.
S27E02_368#Also, I died.
S27E02_377#I can't believe you cooked this.
S27E02_379#Well, the secret to barbecue
S27E02_381#is sitting around doing nothing.
S27E02_383#No wonder I'm great at it.
S27E02_386#Smoky carrot.
S27E02_388#And, Maggie, this is for you.
S27E02_393#Come on, just one bite.
S27E02_394#- Nah-uh! - Uh-huh.
S27E02_395#- Never! - Ever.
S27E02_397#- Forget it. - Remember it.
S27E02_398#No way, Jose!
S27E02_400#Si way, Josefina.
S27E02_401#Nothin' doing.
S27E02_402#Everythin' undoing.
S27E02_404#Oh, fine! One bite.
S27E02_414#Homie, I finally understand gluttony.
S27E02_417#Welcome to America, baby.
S27E02_431#Sorry for dropping by,
S27E02_433#but we smelled your barbecue and couldn't resist.
S27E02_436#Here's some Carl-slaw to go with it.
S27E02_438#I call it "Carl-slaw," because I bought it.
S27E02_449#Look how popular we are.
S27E02_451#That smoker is the best thing that ever happened to us.
S27E02_454#Thank goodness for your selfish choices.
S27E02_457#I make them all for you.
S27E02_464#Yeah, I'm looking for a barbecue bozo name of Homer Simpson?
S27E02_468#Whoa, that's Chew Network's celebrity chef Scotty Boom!
S27E02_471#He's the host of Side Dish Impossible,
S27E02_473#Master Prison Chef and Kill It, Chill It, Grill It.
S27E02_476#Yeah, how you doing, everybody?
S27E02_477#I'm Scotty Boom,
S27E02_479#and I'm challenging you to an Eat-down!
S27E02_481#What's that-- some kind of eat-down?
S27E02_483#It's my new show where I use
S27E02_485#my big-time New York City chef skills
S27E02_487#to obliterate amateur cooks.
S27E02_490#Who would watch such a one-sided farce?
S27E02_492#I'm in.
S27E02_493#This Eat-down's gonna throw down
S27E02_495#at the Springfield Barbecue Festival.
S27E02_498#And when I'm done, you're gonna wish you never heard of food!
S27E02_501#Buy my cookware!
S27E02_504#I'm competing against Scotty Boom!
S27E02_506#He's got what all great chefs have--
S27E02_509#yelling.
S27E02_511#Homer! Homer! Homer!
S27E02_515#You were right, greasy hobo.
S27E02_517#Nothing fixes bad times like good food.
S27E02_520#Up here, I can watch
S27E02_522#anyone in the world take a shower.
S27E02_528#Okay, pork, I'm gonna throw you
S27E02_530#in that magic smoker for 24 hours
S27E02_532#and win that cook-off.
S27E02_534#I only wish you could be alive to see it.
S27E02_536#Then I suppose
S27E02_538#this is my last chance to say
S27E02_539#I love you.
S27E02_544#Oh, no!
S27E02_547#Our smoker's been stolen!
S27E02_548#Why?!
S27E02_551#And when?!
S27E02_553#You didn't lock it up?
S27E02_555#You fat idiot!
S27E02_556#I'm out of here.
S27E02_563#You'll find the Hive, right?
S27E02_565#Tell me you'll find my smoker!
S27E02_566#Ah, don't you worry.
S27E02_568#The Springfield PD is on the case.
S27E02_572#Uh, well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.
S27E02_574#High-end barbeques like yours are easy pickings.
S27E02_577#Smokeheads grab them at night, clean them up.
S27E02_578#Next thing you know,
S27E02_580#it's cooking another family's hot dogs.
S27E02_583#Humanity-- what a joke.
S27E02_585#So, it's gone.
S27E02_587#It's really gone.
S27E02_589#All that's left is the smell of burning hickory
S27E02_591#and four tiny little wheel prints.
S27E02_594#Good night, sweet prints.
S27E02_608#So you lost your grill.
S27E02_610#Snap out of it, you big fat baby.
S27E02_612#Son, this is so much more
S27E02_614#than just losing an outdoor cooking device.
S27E02_616#How to explain this to a child?
S27E02_618#This is the death of hope.
S27E02_620#What are you talking about?
S27E02_623#Everything good that comes into our lives,
S27E02_624#the universe takes away.
S27E02_626#So from now on, I'm just gonna lie here
S27E02_629#and never care again.
S27E02_631#Come on, you know your life sucks.
S27E02_633#Just get drunk like you always do.
S27E02_634#I don't want to.
S27E02_640#Look at him.
S27E02_641#He's lying there like a beached whale
S27E02_642#waiting to explode.
S27E02_644#Maybe we should try to track down that smoker.
S27E02_646#I don't know.
S27E02_647#The whole barbequing scene is pretty pro-meat.
S27E02_650#And all that smoke pollutes the environment.
S27E02_653#This isn't about your boyfriend, the planet.
S27E02_655#I've never seen him this beaten down.
S27E02_659#Okay, look for clues.
S27E02_661#Are there any mud samples we can trace
S27E02_662#to local heaths and moors?
S27E02_665#Sorry, I've been watching a lot of Sherlock.
S27E02_668#Knock it off, boy.
S27E02_669#I don't have any meat for you.
S27E02_671#- Get down! - Wait!
S27E02_673#Santa's Little Helper was in the yard last night
S27E02_675#when the smoker was stolen, but he didn't make a peep.
S27E02_677#Why?
S27E02_682#"Natural Peanut Butter."
S27E02_685#What if someone gave this to the dog
S27E02_687#so he'd be licking instead of barking
S27E02_688#while they took the smoker?!
S27E02_690#You got a clue, boy!
S27E02_691#A clue!
S27E02_693#Who's a smart dog?
S27E02_695#Who's a smart dog?
S27E02_703#You're watching
S27E02_704#Eat-down with Scotty Boom.
S27E02_706#Come on, Homie.
S27E02_709#We can't let this Empire State jabroni beat us.
S27E02_712#This week I took on the Gilbert family of Portland, Maine.
S27E02_715#They've been making clam chowder for generations.
S27E02_717#How is that better than something I spent a day on?
S27E02_720#I win!
S27E02_722#Manhattan chowder, baby!
S27E02_724#NYC!
S27E02_726#Greatest city, greatest chowder!
S27E02_729#The Gilbert family has learned a valuable lesson--
S27E02_732#screw everything.
S27E02_734#Dad, we're gonna find that smoker!
S27E02_737#To try is to fail!
S27E02_739#There's only one store in town
S27E02_741#that sells all-natural peanut butter.
S27E02_752#Don't worry, I know how to talk to these people.
S27E02_755#Thank goodness you have organic fennel.
S27E02_758#The fennel at the farmer's market is only transitional.
S27E02_760#Typical.
S27E02_763#Small farmers ruining it for the really small farmers.
S27E02_766#So, could you maybe tell me
S27E02_768#who bought this brand of peanut butter?
S27E02_769#Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.
S27E02_771#You want me to violate my customers' privacy?
S27E02_773#Who are you working for?
S27E02_775#The NSA? Big pharma?
S27E02_777#Amazon Prime?
S27E02_779#Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!
S27E02_782#My hoops!
S27E02_784#My ridiculous flesh hoops!
S27E02_787#There!
S27E02_789#Someone's ringing up peanut butter.
S27E02_791#Nelson!
S27E02_794#What are you playing there, Nelson?
S27E02_796#Clash of Castles?
S27E02_797#So what if it is?
S27E02_799#Your castle's pretty well-defended.
S27E02_800#Level six catapults.
S27E02_801#Level seven sorcerers.
S27E02_803#Maxed-out trolls.
S27E02_806#Uh, yeah, well.
S27E02_808#Yeah, gets the job done.
S27E02_810#I tell you, those are some nice upgrades.
S27E02_813#Expensive upgrades.
S27E02_815#Upgrades like that cost gems.
S27E02_817#And gems cost cash.
S27E02_819#Expensive cash.
S27E02_821#Where'd you get the cash, Nelson?
S27E02_822#I don't use gems!
S27E02_824#I'm a grinder! A grinder!
S27E02_844#What are they?
S27E02_846#They're like televisions...
S27E02_848#but they just keep going!
S27E02_850#He's meeting with someone.
S27E02_852#That's always a sign of guilt.
S27E02_858#Hope you don't mind.
S27E02_860#I cooked some dinner on it.
S27E02_866#Ah, smell you later.
S27E02_874#This is our chance.
S27E02_877#Hot! Hot!
S27E02_879#Hot!
S27E02_880#Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!
S27E02_882#Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!
S27E02_893#The universe does hate us.
S27E02_895#It feels good to surrender.
S27E02_899#Good girl, Maggie.
S27E02_901#Give up young.
S27E02_910#Get up off that floor!
S27E02_912#We are on a head-to-head cook-off
S27E02_914#that'll be shown on TV and probably some planes.
S27E02_917#We don't have the smoker.
S27E02_920#Just let us forfeit with dignity.
S27E02_922#We still have to try.
S27E02_924#This isn't a family of quitters.
S27E02_925#Sure we are.
S27E02_927#We always have been and more so now.
S27E02_929#I'm a quitter.
S27E02_931#And I'll back down to anyone who says I'm not.
S27E02_933#Come on, Buddhists aren't quitters.
S27E02_935#Actually, Mom, Buddhism is really
S27E02_937#just quitting in yoga pants.
S27E02_939#This is a Live Strong bracelet.
S27E02_942#Lance Armstrong never quit.
S27E02_944#He never quit the Tour de France.
S27E02_946#He never quit lying about his steroid use.
S27E02_948#And he still hasn't totally come clean.
S27E02_951#Now get in the car!
S27E02_955#Eat-down! Eat-down! Eat-down! Yee-haw!
S27E02_959#I can handle this barbeque competition.
S27E02_962#All I need is a little help from an old friend.
S27E02_967#I'm Alton Brown
S27E02_968#and welcome to Eat-down!
S27E02_971#Today Scotty Boom takes on the Simpsons in...
S27E02_976#And I can tell you this-- it will be edited
S27E02_979#to be dramatic.
S27E02_981#Marge, do you think your meat
S27E02_983#has what it takes to win this Eat-down?
S27E02_985#It sure does.
S27E02_987#Homer, what about you?
S27E02_988#No way in hell.
S27E02_989#What about you kids?
S27E02_991#Are you pumped up to beat Scotty Boom?
S27E02_993#Happiness is an illusion.
S27E02_994#What she said.
S27E02_997#Looks like the Simpsons are playing
S27E02_998#mind games with you, Scotty.
S27E02_1000#Are you feeling the pressure?
S27E02_1002#No pressure.
S27E02_1004#I'm throwing down the taste of New York.
S27E02_1006#My recipe's infused with Times Square, the Bronx Zoo
S27E02_1009#and the Sex and the City walking tour.
S27E02_1011#The Simpsons better bring their A game.
S27E02_1013#F! F game!
S27E02_1017#I call this my Never-Give-Up Brisket.
S27E02_1020#The secret ingredient is hope.
S27E02_1027#How many spices did you put in this?
S27E02_1029#All of them.
S27E02_1038#I've never seen such unusual grill marks.
S27E02_1041#This pattern looks like a honeycomb.
S27E02_1043#What?
S27E02_1046#That meat was cooked on the Hive!
S27E02_1048#This garlic-sucking tunnel trash stole our smoker!
S27E02_1051#Ah, this little flyover's crazy.
S27E02_1054#I cooked that meat myself right here over here.
S27E02_1059#The grill marks don't match.
S27E02_1061#Dead meat doesn't lie.
S27E02_1066#Scotty Boom, you are hereby banned
S27E02_1068#from the Chew Network.
S27E02_1070#You are no longer a celebrity chef.
S27E02_1073#You're just a chef.
S27E02_1074#Take him away, Chief.
S27E02_1076#Grand theft smoker.
S27E02_1077#Sounds like a crime to me.
S27E02_1083#Apparently, the winner of the Eat-down
S27E02_1085#is the Simpsons.
S27E02_1089#Isn't this a little too easy?
S27E02_1091#Why would a professional chef cheat?
S27E02_1094#And how does Nelson fit in?
S27E02_1096#And where the heck is our smoker?
S27E02_1102#That's the ringtone from the scrapyard!
S27E02_1104#Get him!
S27E02_1111#Bones! Bones!
S27E02_1113#I'm covered in death!
S27E02_1117#My hoops!
S27E02_1119#Dad, stop him!
S27E02_1121#I'm done trying.
S27E02_1123#Dad, please! No one's asking you to care.
S27E02_1125#Just trip a stranger!
S27E02_1138#A kid?
S27E02_1139#Why'd you steal our smoker?
S27E02_1141#Why'd you frame Scotty Boom?
S27E02_1143#'Cause he's my dad.
S27E02_1145#I'm Tyler Boom.
S27E02_1148#My dad is so busy shooting his TV shows
S27E02_1151#and going to the openings and closings
S27E02_1153#of his restaurants...
S27E02_1154#I never see him.
S27E02_1156#You destroyed your Dad's career
S27E02_1159#so he'd spend more time with you?
S27E02_1162#I met this kid Nelson
S27E02_1164#playing Clash of Castles online.
S27E02_1166#You know, I knew my dad was coming to your town,
S27E02_1169#so I hired Nelson to take your smoker.
S27E02_1172#And then my nanny cooked some meat on it
S27E02_1174#and switched it so it looked like my dad cheated.
S27E02_1178#This was the only way.
S27E02_1180#The only way I thought of.
S27E02_1182#Son, why didn't you tell me I was a terrible father?
S27E02_1185#Because I'm from New York.
S27E02_1187#We don't talk about our feelings, huh?
S27E02_1188#Yeah, I understand, son.
S27E02_1190#I'm from New York, too.
S27E02_1191#FDR Drive.
S27E02_1193#The West Side Highway.
S27E02_1194#Investment banking.
S27E02_1196#The gallery scene.
S27E02_1197#Knicks suck.
S27E02_1199#Oh, Papa!
S27E02_1201#They suck so hard!
S27E02_1202#One more thing, Tyler.
S27E02_1203#Where's the Hive?
S27E02_1215#You're always so much hotter than I think you're gonna be.
S27E02_1219#Thanks, guys, for not giving up, then giving up,
S27E02_1223#then not giving up again, then I forget.
S27E02_1226#BBQ is like family--
S27E02_1228#the cheap cuts of meat that nobody wants.
S27E02_1230#But if you treat them right,
S27E02_1232#they turn into the best thing in the world.
S27E02_1235#Yeah, barbecue's yummy.
S27E02_1237#Chinese is pretty good, too.
S27E02_1239#Meh, it depends on the place.
S27E03_95#Homie, I feel about my family like you felt about that car.
S27E03_98#No one loves a person that much.
S27E03_100#Please go, for me?
S27E03_102#All right, but remember the signal.
S27E03_104#If I tug my ear, it's time for us to leave.
S27E03_107#I'm switching to my left ear
S27E03_109#because of what happened last time.
S27E03_137#No you don't.
S27E03_139#Your grandmother knit this for you,
S27E03_141#so act like you wear it all the time.
S27E03_158#She has a juice box.
S27E03_159#Why can't I have a juice box?
S27E03_161#Because when she sticks in the straw,
S27E03_164#she doesn't slip and hit an artery.
S27E03_167#Oh, I'll never have juice.
S27E03_170#*Happy birthday to you*  
S27E03_173#*Happy birthday, dear*
S27E03_175#*Mom*
S27E03_176#*Grandma*
S27E03_178#*All of the above*
S27E03_180#*Happy birthday to you.*
S27E03_182#Thank you.
S27E03_184#Jacqueline, I took the money I usually give
S27E03_188#to con artists and preachers and bought you these flowers.
S27E03_193#Nothing tops a simple romantic gesture.
S27E03_198#Except a rich man flaunting his wealth.
S27E03_205#The one thing I can't beat-- competition.
S27E03_211#Oh, Jacqueline, I fell in love with you
S27E03_213#the moment I came down with dementia.
S27E03_216#So to win your heart, I got you an old-fashioned music player.
S27E03_221#Mr. Yo-Yo Ma.
S27E03_225#No one said there'd be music.
S27E03_227#There's always room for cello.
S27E03_235#I know when I'm licked, Burns.
S27E03_237#She's yours.
S27E03_238#Um, not interested.
S27E03_240#I just don't want you to have her.
S27E03_242#That's the meanest thing I ever heard,
S27E03_245#and I used to practice cello on the subway.
S27E03_250#I'm next!
S27E03_255#Hey, you two, quit having fun.
S27E03_257#Trust me, nothing I've done today has been fun.
S27E03_259#Hey, hey, the plastic's here for a reason--
S27E03_262#to keep the couch clean.
S27E03_263#Watch and learn, boy.
S27E03_267#Voila, now I take a simple napkin and...
S27E03_274#Who's ready to see some slides of us as teenagers?
S27E03_277#Here are the slides.
S27E03_279#Oh, just one box.
S27E03_281#Five terabytes.
S27E03_284#That's over 50,000 caro usels of family fun.
S27E03_291#Here's us walking up the steps
S27E03_294#of Teotihuacan's pyramid of the sun.
S27E03_297#Walking, walking, stopping, walking.
S27E03_300#Walking, walking, walking. 
S27E03_301#Stopping, stopping.
S27E03_303#Oh. Walking, walking,
S27E03_305#walking, walking, blister-popping.
S27E03_307#Walking, walking.
S27E03_309#Stopping, walking, walking...
S27E03_312#Oh, I sure miss Dad.
S27E03_314#We're here to watch old photos, not reminisce.
S27E03_316#Walking, walking...
S27E03_318#How did Grampa Bouvier die?
S27E03_319#No one's ever told us.
S27E03_321#You know what, I actually don't know.
S27E03_324#Me neither. Not a clue.
S27E03_326#Girls, I'm afraid I didn't tell any of you for a reason.
S27E03_334#The real story,
S27E03_336#and it was something people were ashamed to say at the time,
S27E03_339#is that he died of lung cancer.
S27E03_343#Mom, how could you know that and still let us smoke?
S27E03_346#I thought it made you look cool.
S27E03_350#Hey, Lis, do you think I can climb walls like Spider-Man
S27E03_353#with denture cream on my hands?
S27E03_355#Nope.
S27E03_357#Next time, you should wait for my answer.
S27E03_360#Knock it off, your grandmother's bathroom is not a toy chest.
S27E03_363#Vicodin.
S27E03_365#I think it's time, Selma dear.
S27E03_367#Time we quit smoking.
S27E03_379#Well, anyway, happy birthday.
S27E03_390#Man, I can't believe your sisters stopped smoking.
S27E03_393#I just hope they don't put on weight.
S27E03_397#You're so fat!
S27E03_401#You're even fatter.
S27E03_402#Damn straight.
S27E03_404#No one out-fats me.
S27E03_412#Time for beddy-bye.
S27E03_414#Now, don't sleep on your stomach.
S27E03_416#Or is it your back?
S27E03_417#Can never remember.
S27E03_420#Whichever is the comfortable one, don't do that.
S27E03_464#Say hello to fun.
S27E03_465#Oh, yeah!
S27E03_466#Oh, no!
S27E03_467#Hoppy!
S27E03_481#In this house Maggie is safe.
S27E03_501#Excuse me, I'd like a license to operate heavy machinery.
S27E03_505#We don't do that here.
S27E03_508#Please? To me, everything is heavy.
S27E03_510#No.
S27E03_512#Patty, what are you doing?
S27E03_514#Selma quit smoking, and she's never been nicer.
S27E03_516#Here's your new license.
S27E03_518#Under "Eyes," I put "Red and dilated."
S27E03_521#Ooh, thank you, sir.
S27E03_523#Selma, not smoking hasn't affected you at all.
S27E03_526#How is that possible?
S27E03_528#I even smell cigarette smoke when it's not around.
S27E03_530#Like right now.
S27E03_532#Maybe you're having a stroke.
S27E03_534#Phantom smells are a symptom.
S27E03_538#Eh, what's the penalty for driving a tractor drunk
S27E03_541#through a Renaissance Faire?
S27E03_543#Can't help you-- I might be having a stroke.
S27E03_546#I have to consult a competent medical professional.
S27E03_552#Got that.
S27E03_553#Got that.
S27E03_555#Who doesn't have that?
S27E03_559#Anyone here to get an ambulance license?
S27E03_560#That would be me.
S27E03_561#Here you go.
S27E03_563#I lied.
S27E03_568#Patty, all your tests are positive.
S27E03_570#I mean, negative.
S27E03_571#Always get those two confused.
S27E03_572#You're fine.
S27E03_575#But I still smell smoke.
S27E03_577#That's odd.
S27E03_578#So do I.
S27E03_579#Do you smell anything, Selma?
S27E03_581#Nope.
S27E03_582#Wait a minute.
S27E03_583#Are you smoking?
S27E03_590#That's right, I am.
S27E03_592#I quit for only ten minutes before I relapsed.
S27E03_596#And it was the best cigarette of my life.
S27E03_600#I have never been angrier at you.
S27E03_603#Me, too-- this is a hospital.
S27E03_604#If you want to smoke,
S27E03_606#go do it in the stairwell with the doctors.
S27E03_610#I'll miss you so much.
S27E03_612#Leave me Jub-Jub.
S27E03_613#Fine.
S27E03_619#At least you still smoke.
S27E03_624#I hate it when you and Selma fight.
S27E03_626#Me, too. I also hate it when they agree.
S27E03_628#Homer, please be nice.
S27E03_630#Patty's our guest.
S27E03_631#For how long?
S27E03_632#Where's she gonna sleep?
S27E03_633#On our couch.
S27E03_635#That's where we do our couch gags!
S27E03_636#See?
S27E03_637#Oh, fine.
S27E03_639#She'll stay with the baby.
S27E03_642#Well, Magster, it looks like
S27E03_644#you and I are going to be cellmates.
S27E03_652#Nature!
S27E03_654#I've got a hot curling iron!
S27E03_655#Hold this.
S27E03_661#Oh, Marge, the kids are all asleep
S27E03_663#and the dog's been walked.
S27E03_665#There's only one thing left to do.
S27E03_670#Did you turn the security alarm on?
S27E03_672#It's still broken.
S27E03_675#Ooh, well, then come here, you.
S27E03_679#What the hell was that?!
S27E03_680#It's just my sister snoring.
S27E03_682#She has a very fatty septum.
S27E03_684#But it doesn't have to ruin our fun.
S27E03_727#Okay, which of you kids knows how to drive?
S27E03_730#And which is sober?
S27E03_732#Whew, thank God for Designated Dorothy.
S27E03_748#All right, everybody go to bed.
S27E03_750#Those of you who got to get up early,
S27E03_752#sleep on top of the pile.
S27E03_755#Hey, Brandine!
S27E03_756#I caught us a possum!
S27E03_757#You want to name it
S27E03_759#before we eat it or after?
S27E03_761#During!
S27E03_763#Beauregard, you've been promoted
S27E03_765#from guarding my family
S27E03_767#to guarding this possum.
S27E03_770#That's a good dog.
S27E03_778#Hey, baby.
S27E03_781#How about that rain check for last night?
S27E03_784#Don't look at me!
S27E03_786#But you're everywhere! Freak!
S27E03_788#Don't you ever knock?
S27E03_790#Get out of here, go away!
S27E03_793#Thank God I'm blind.
S27E03_794#Yo, I'm next.
S27E03_795#No!
S27E03_797#Whoa! What the hell?
S27E03_799#I did that with love, boy.
S27E03_800#What's all the hubbub?
S27E03_802#- Oh, thank you, Dad. - It's okay, son.
S27E03_804#- Thank you, thank you, thank you! - It's okay, it's okay.
S27E03_806#No, really, thank you, thank you, thank you!
S27E03_808#It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
S27E03_810#All right, already!
S27E03_811#Just take a shower.
S27E03_815#I need someone to talk to.
S27E03_818#Thank God I've got a past full of lonely men to draw from.
S27E03_823#Disco Stu is over you.
S27E03_827#Oh, Disco Stu
S27E03_829#needs a Zoloft or two.
S27E03_833#Who am I kidding?
S27E03_835#The one I should be talking to
S27E03_837#is the one who's always been there for me...
S27E03_839#my cigarette.
S27E03_840#Forget about your sister.
S27E03_842#You've got me.
S27E03_844#For the rest of your life I'll be the first thing
S27E03_845#you think about every morning.
S27E03_848#And the last thing you do every night.
S27E03_853#Hmm, looks like I have a choice to make.
S27E03_857#I'm in your hair!
S27E03_866#Listen, about this morning,
S27E03_869#I'm sorry I walked in on you!
S27E03_874#Oh, yeah.
S27E03_876#I'm about to say something
S27E03_878#I never thought I'd say to you-- something nice.
S27E03_882#I only mock you because I'm jealous
S27E03_885#of what Marge has in you.
S27E03_887#I only have Selma.
S27E03_889#And now I don't even have that.
S27E03_894#Oh, Patty, I've waited so long
S27E03_896#for you to open a window of niceness.
S27E03_898#That was it!
S27E03_899#Window shut!
S27E03_903#Ah, what the heck!
S27E03_911#What are you doing here?
S27E03_913#Apologizing.
S27E03_914#And I want you to know
S27E03_916#I quit smoking for good.
S27E03_918#You quit for me?
S27E03_920#I quit for us.
S27E03_922#Hmm, that's actually more selfish.
S27E03_924#But it sounds really nice.
S27E03_928#Okay, Maggie, throw the ball to me.
S27E03_929#Throw the ball.
S27E03_932#Okay, how about I throw the ball?
S27E03_935#It's okay.
S27E03_936#You'll learn to do things after you're a baby.
S27E03_986#*Spider-Pig*
S27E03_990#*Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig*
S27E03_994#Let's see, we got "Possum pot pie,
S27E03_997#"General Chang's possum with cashews,
S27E03_1001#possum foam with pouch reduction."
S27E03_1005#Hey, save your hissing for the frying pan!
S27E03_1124#What the...?
S27E03_1126#It's a bunch of animals acting like humans!
S27E03_1134#Oh, well, there goes our dinner.
S27E03_1137#And I had such a delightful moonshine pairing for it, too.
S27E03_1141#Got 91 points from Robert Trailerparker.
S27E03_1146#Okay, well, uh, possum's gone.
S27E03_1149#But you got fingernails to chew on.
S27E03_1151#Who knows what's under them?
S27E03_1153#Ooh, I got pizza!
S27E03_1155#I got poop.
S27E03_1157#It's nice to have you back, Patty.
S27E03_1160#I had to do some things I regretted 'cause you were gone.
S27E03_1162#You said it was for real this time.
S27E03_1165#I said what you wanted to hear!
S27E03_1167#Disco Stu is back on Tinder.
S27E03_1171#It's nice to be back.
S27E03_1173#Since I've stopped smoking,
S27E03_1175#my sense of smell has really come back.
S27E03_1179#Who knew a small apartment with two women,
S27E03_1181#a baby and an iguana would smell so bad?
S27E03_1187#- Cigarette? - Yes!
S27E03_1193#Here's to smoking and you.
S27E03_1196#Two things that'll always be in my heart.
S27E03_1200#Is this a happy ending?
S27E03_1202#It's edgy.
S27E03_1229#Hoppy, you're back!
S27E03_1231#Hey, Brandine!
S27E03_1233#Put out the fancy possum china!
S27E03_1236#I've heard of wanting a cracker, but becoming one-- oh, no!
S27E04_53#Well, you gotta bring it.
S27E04_55#Halloweening your house is a dying art.
S27E04_58#More and more people are turning off their porch lights
S27E04_60#and pretending they're not home.
S27E04_63#Halloween skippers.
S27E04_65#Skippers!
S27E04_66#How can you reject a holiday
S27E04_68#where you can serve candy from a salad bowl?
S27E04_71#Bad news, dad.
S27E04_72#You stored the plastic skeletons
S27E04_74#too close to the furnace.
S27E04_76#Eh, I'll take it to the old folks' home
S27E04_77#and tell granpa it's his new roommate.
S27E04_79#Everyone in the car!
S27E04_80#We're making a skeleton run
S27E04_82#to the halloween pop-up store.
S27E04_83#Ooh, while we're there
S27E04_85#We can get a costume for the dog.
S27E04_87#Nothing says you love a pet
S27E04_89#Like letting him be part of the human fun.
S27E04_91#Who wants to be a yoda?
S27E04_93#You want to be a yoda!
S27E04_101#Oh, man, I can't wait for tonight!
S27E04_103#I'm finally old enough
S27E04_105#For Krustyland halloween horror night.
S27E04_107#Oh, yeah, they do it up right.
S27E04_108#Wait till you try the black cotton candy.
S27E04_110#It tastes just like cotton candy.
S27E04_113#Tomorrow, when my friends ask me about it,
S27E04_115#I'm going to say, "Eh, it wasn't that big a deal."
S27E04_118#But it's gonna be a really, really big deal!
S27E04_121#Welcome, seasonal customer,
S27E04_122#to my pop-up emporium.
S27E04_124#Behold my terrifying joke name.
S27E04_126#A-boo!
S27E04_129#Hmm, you know, I actually like that better.
S27E04_132#Why are you not working?
S27E04_134#'cause I'm still coming down
S27E04_137#from huffing all that glow stick juice, man.
S27E04_141#Oh, I'm strung out on silly string.
S27E04_147#Go, go! Back to work!
S27E04_149#Go de-tangle the novelty cobwebs,
S27E04_151#You lazy trick-or-treat trash.
S27E04_156#Aren't you being a little hard on them?
S27E04_158#Mrs. Simpson,
S27E04_159#these are pop-up people.
S27E04_161#Temporary workers who drift from town to town,
S27E04_164#Holiday to holiday,
S27E04_166#Living off candy hearts and sleeping on easter grass.
S27E04_169#If I do not show them a firm hand,
S27E04_171#they would rob me like striped hamburger thief
S27E04_174#robs restaurant meat clown.
S27E04_177#Ooh! Mariachi skeletons.
S27E04_181#They're spooky, but they also teach you about Mexico.
S27E04_184#Psst! Hey, big man, how about this deal:
S27E04_187#you buy one from me-- in cash--
S27E04_190#and I'll load three more into your car for free.
S27E04_193#That is a great deal.
S27E04_195#Just don't tell old man squishee about it.
S27E04_203#You got some great guys working here.
S27E04_205#They just gave me a really good deal.
S27E04_207#Really?
S27E04_208#Tell me of this deal.
S27E04_210#Okay, but don't tell old man squishee about it.
S27E04_213#We hate him.
S27E04_215#Get out. Out, all of you!
S27E04_217#Pop-up scum! Out!
S27E04_219#No one rips off Apu Nahasapeemapetilon!
S27E04_223#Now take your suspiciously full duffle bags and go!
S27E04_228#You're gonna be real sorry for getting us fired.
S27E04_230#Well, I'm sorry now.
S27E04_232#Yeah, you're gonna be.
S27E04_234#I said, I'm sorry now.
S27E04_237#We said you're gonna be!
S27E04_240#I know when I'm sorry, and I'm sorry now!
S27E04_243#You guys don't know me at all.
S27E04_250#Hand stamp required for re-entry!
S27E04_255#That's not scary.
S27E04_257#I thought this was going to be scary.
S27E04_263#Scary!
S27E04_266#That's really, uh, anatomical.
S27E04_268#Lot of anatomy there.
S27E04_270#Oh, yeah, the gore is super realistic.
S27E04_272#It's gotta be--
S27E04_274#Today's consumer is just too sophisticated.
S27E04_283#I want to go home! I want to go home!
S27E04_286#What? No!
S27E04_287#We just got here!
S27E04_289#Lisa, honey, I think you should stay.
S27E04_292#And not because the tickets were super expensive,
S27E04_296#even though they were super expensive.
S27E04_299#But remember, you were really looking forward
S27E04_301#to the fun of being scared
S27E04_303#by stuff you know isn't real.
S27E04_307#Unlike the money I spent on this, which is very real.
S27E04_310#Okay.
S27E04_312#Okay, I'll give it another try.
S27E04_314#Good, now take my hand
S27E04_316#and I'll walk you through this roiling zombie horde.
S27E04_319#This isn't real.
S27E04_321#This isn't real. This isn't real.
S27E04_323#This isn't real.
S27E04_329#Sir? Sir?
S27E04_332#- I-I’m not... - Hold on, Lisa,
S27E04_334#daddy's picking out a pretzel topping.
S27E04_336#Sir?
S27E04_339#Oh, no, I'm lost!
S27E04_340#Okay, find a grown-up.
S27E04_341#Find a grown-up.
S27E04_344#Excuse me, I'm lost.
S27E04_345#Could you please help me...
S27E04_350#I can't find my family
S27E04_351#and I'm really scared and I...
S27E04_371#Sir, looks like we've got
S27E04_373#a scaredy-pants situation here.
S27E04_374#Zoom in and scan for fear.
S27E04_378#Terror level seven and rising.
S27E04_380#Shut it down. Shut it all down.
S27E04_382#Shut the whole damn thing down.
S27E04_388#Attention!
S27E04_390#Bring all laughter and exhilaration
S27E04_391#to a complete stop.
S27E04_394#The terrifying good time is on hold.
S27E04_398#We have located and are removing
S27E04_400#the baby that thinks this is real.
S27E04_402#Reset time is 65 minutes.
S27E04_405#All parking validations are now void.
S27E04_408#Sir...
S27E04_419#Lisa, aren't you going to wear
S27E04_421#your costume to school?
S27E04_423#No, I'm not doing halloween this year.
S27E04_426#Oh, sweetie, I know you had a scare last night.
S27E04_429#But you worked so hard on your Frida Kahlo outfit.
S27E04_432#Maybe just wear the eyebrow and mustache?
S27E04_434#No!
S27E04_435#No!
S27E04_437#You kids look great.
S27E04_438#Delightful.
S27E04_441#No place like home.
S27E04_443#Hold on, simpson.
S27E04_444#Let's take a look at that buccaneer costume.
S27E04_447#No weapons, of course.
S27E04_449#Bandana, possible gang wear.
S27E04_451#Eye patch, offensive to the half-blind.
S27E04_453#Oh, and just to reassure
S27E04_455#those who are afraid of pirates...
S27E04_475#No! Leave me alone!
S27E04_477#Leave me alone!
S27E04_486#Lisa...
S27E04_496#Homer...
S27E04_498#I think we should take down everscream terrors.
S27E04_501#Wha-- w-we... We can't!
S27E04_503#I'm the Mozart of halloween decorations,
S27E04_506#and tonight is the super bowl.
S27E04_507#Lisa's in a bad place.
S27E04_509#You know how sensitive she is.
S27E04_511#We don't want her to go back to...
S27E04_513#Tailee.
S27E04_515#No, she wouldn't.
S27E04_516#She couldn't.
S27E04_517#Not Tailee.
S27E04_519#Where is she?
S27E04_526#Ah, let's see.
S27E04_528#Oh, god.
S27E04_530#We're too late.
S27E04_532#The glue stick didn't hold.
S27E04_537#So, Tailee's back.
S27E04_540#Tailee just makes me feel so safe.
S27E04_543#I don't know why I ever gave it up.
S27E04_544#It breaks my heart
S27E04_546#that lisa can't deal with her emotions without a crutch.
S27E04_549#Well, kids are weak, Marge.
S27E04_552#Oh, yeah.
S27E04_555#No. No!
S27E04_556#Stop it!
S27E04_558#Why are you taking down everscream terrors?
S27E04_560#Our house has to be a halloween-free zone.
S27E04_564#Your sister has a tummy ache in her courage.
S27E04_566#What?
S27E04_567#Lisa goes nuts and you turn us into...
S27E04_570#into skippers?!
S27E04_572#I know what this makes us.
S27E04_573#I know!
S27E04_575#Honey, I knew you'd be upset,
S27E04_577#and that you'd think only of yourself.
S27E04_580#So I'm taking you to the best
S27E04_581#trick-or-treating block party
S27E04_583#in the tri-springfield area.
S27E04_586#There's a dad who's a deejay.
S27E04_588#Even an E.T. Who says your name.
S27E04_591#What if I tell the E.T. my name is a swear?
S27E04_593#He'll have to say it.
S27E04_594#Then I'm in.
S27E04_611#Okay, sweetie,
S27E04_614#just you and me spending a regular eve together.
S27E04_617#Nothing hallows about it.
S27E04_619#I'm sorry I ruined halloween, dad.
S27E04_621#Ruined?
S27E04_623#Why, you just created a new holiday...
S27E04_626#Puzzle Wednesday.
S27E04_629#A tabby and a calico.
S27E04_632#I wouldn't want to be that ribbon.
S27E04_635#Oh, trick-or-treaters.
S27E04_637#Don't worry, I'll get rid of them.
S27E04_640#Trick or treat.
S27E04_641#Porch light's off, kids.
S27E04_642#Don't you know what that means?
S27E04_644#We're not here for candy, big man.
S27E04_647#Hey, you're those pop-up scuzzos.
S27E04_649#What do you scuzzos want?
S27E04_651#We want our jobs back.
S27E04_652#Look, I don't want to be rude,
S27E04_655#but you sad losers should go suck somewhere else.
S27E04_660#That? Oh, that was just
S27E04_662#a kindly priest here to bless our home.
S27E04_665#I told him to keep moving.
S27E04_669#Another visitor?
S27E04_671#Isn't life funny and safe?
S27E04_674#Can't you jerks take a hint?!
S27E04_690#Mind games.
S27E04_695#Whoa, look at this line.
S27E04_697#This neighborhood has to be good.
S27E04_700#Sorry, ma'am, residents only.
S27E04_702#Too many randos crashed the block party last year,
S27E04_705#so "Spine chills" is pine hills only.
S27E04_708#Mom, you said we could go here.
S27E04_711#We will, we will.
S27E04_714#Look, I've got a groupon here for a zip line adventure.
S27E04_717#Let us in, and it's yours.
S27E04_720#Zip-lining is everything to me, but if I take that,
S27E04_723#I'm not worth the folding chair I'm sitting on.
S27E04_725#Now, turn around and go.
S27E04_733#Aw, a bounce house.
S27E04_740#E.T.?
S27E04_742#Hello, Scrotum.
S27E04_746#It's over.
S27E04_747#I missed halloween.
S27E04_752#I can't let Lisa know
S27E04_754#We're being stalked by vengeful seasonal thugs.
S27E04_757#I'll just whistle a happy tune.
S27E04_779#Why are you locking up the house?
S27E04_781#Why...? You've...
S27E04_783#Wh-why does anything happen?
S27E04_785#Why are blue jeans blue?
S27E04_786#Who invented haircuts?
S27E04_789#It's all just stuff I'm saying.
S27E04_793#How did that get there?
S27E04_798#Okay, okay, intruders in the house.
S27E04_799#Intruders in the house.
S27E04_800#Got to call the cops.
S27E04_802#Where's my cell phone?
S27E04_803#They took my cell phone.
S27E04_806#And they forgot to pay my phone bill.
S27E04_809#Wait, why are we going to Mr. Flanders' house?
S27E04_812#Oh, you know, to see his kids.
S27E04_814#I want to finally find out which one is Rod and which one is Max.
S27E04_818#Tailee, I left him inside.
S27E04_824#Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!
S27E04_826#Dad?
S27E04_829#Oh. Oh, Lisa.
S27E04_831#You're here, we're safe.
S27E04_833#Everything's fine.
S27E04_835#Except for this inexplicable fog.
S27E04_843#Oh, my god!
S27E04_844#Oh, my god! No!
S27E04_846#We got to get out of here!
S27E04_848#- He smells so bad! - Come on, this way!
S27E04_850#- Oh, my god, dad, help! - This way! Come on!
S27E04_854#Give me a hit off that fog machine.
S27E04_856#We got a fat man to beat on.
S27E04_869#Here we come.
S27E04_871#We're coming to get you.
S27E04_880#Okay, okay, I don't think those pop-up guys saw us come up here.
S27E04_885#This isn't real, this isn't real, this isn't real.
S27E04_888#Honey, I'm your dad.
S27E04_891#I've lied to you more times than there are stars in the sky.
S27E04_895#But I got to be straight.
S27E04_896#This is real.
S27E04_900#Okay, halloween isn't over yet.
S27E04_902#We can still squeeze in some solid trick-or-treating.
S27E04_907#Hurry, go, go, go!
S27E04_909#What? What's the rush?
S27E04_911#Go, go, have fun.
S27E04_912#There's still time.
S27E04_918#It's too late.
S27E04_921#The change is upon us.
S27E04_924#*The children are all sleeping*
S27E04_927#*Not one kiddie on the streets*
S27E04_929#*The fun's just starting for mommy and daddy*
S27E04_931#*Sexy tricks*
S27E04_933#*And boozy treats*
S27E04_935#*Drunken hobbits*
S27E04_937#*Hit on slutty crayons*
S27E04_941#*Policeman dressed as bondage frankenstein*
S27E04_945#*Your kid's teacher*
S27E04_947#*In a steampunk orgy*
S27E04_952#*Grown-ups become monsters after 9:00*
S27E04_957#*It's time for grown-up halloween*
S27E04_962#*Close your eyes if you're under 18*
S27E04_966#*It's my chance to show boobs*
S27E04_968#*Live my fantasy*
S27E04_971#*'cause tomorrow morning*
S27E04_974#*We won't remember a thing*
S27E04_976#*Our lives are awful and dreary*
S27E04_980#*So tonight we're going way, way, way, way, way too far*
S27E04_982#*Hide your kids*
S27E04_984#*This cannot be unseen*
S27E04_989#*It's naked, wasted, grown-up halloween*
S27E04_997#Can't hide forever, thumb-head.
S27E04_999#Sooner or later, you're gonna have to buy
S27E04_1001#Thanksgiving decoration,
S27E04_1004#and we'll be waiting by the Indian corn.
S27E04_1009#Oh, no, now they're trashing our stuff.
S27E04_1013#Oh, they've tangled up my wind chimes.
S27E04_1015#How will I know when the wind is blowing?
S27E04_1018#I hate this, I hate feeling afraid.
S27E04_1020#Maybe I shouldn't admit this to my daughter,
S27E04_1023#but I'm scared, too,
S27E04_1025#but you can't let fear shut down your brain,
S27E04_1028#because between the two of us, we've only got one good one.
S27E04_1031#I've got it.
S27E04_1036#What if... we use these decorations to signal for help?
S27E04_1039#You're right.
S27E04_1042#I may not be the smartest dad or the bravest or the smartest,
S27E04_1046#but I am great at one thing-- drawing attention to our home.
S27E04_1049#If we're gonna get out of this,
S27E04_1051#we're going to need every holiday you've got.
S27E04_1058#*Halloween is so bueno...*
S27E04_1061#Ooh, the señor skeletinos.
S27E04_1064#He must have leaned on the "Try me" button.
S27E04_1069#We're coming to get you.
S27E04_1072#And no fancy ceiling door is gonna stop us.
S27E04_1079#Almost got it.
S27E04_1081#Stuck.
S27E04_1084#They're coming-- hurry!
S27E04_1087#Time to wake up the neighborhood.
S27E04_1096#Here we go.
S27E04_1100#Hurry.
S27E04_1101#Light the fireworks.
S27E04_1103#The match won't stay lit-- it's too windy.
S27E04_1107#I've got something that will burn.
S27E04_1110#Are you sure?
S27E04_1112#Yes, this ratty piece of polyester
S27E04_1115#has been soaking in face oil for eight years.
S27E04_1118#Light him up.
S27E04_1124#Good-bye, Tailee.
S27E04_1131#What the...?
S27E04_1141#Now plug it in!
S27E04_1145#Help, help!
S27E04_1146#Help, we're up here!
S27E04_1149#Everscream terrors needs our help!
S27E04_1151#We can get plastered and hit on our coworkers later.
S27E04_1152#Come on!
S27E04_1154#Get 'em, Zardoz!
S27E04_1157#Sexy drunks, stop them!
S27E04_1163#Tragic, really.
S27E04_1165#For are these guys not victims, too, in a way,
S27E04_1168#of our disposable pop-up culture?
S27E04_1171#When you get out, look me up.
S27E04_1173#I know a guy who owns a 99-cent store.
S27E04_1176#99-cent store?
S27E04_1179#Those places are open year-round.
S27E04_1181#The holidays will come and go,
S27E04_1183#but... we'll stay.
S27E04_1189#Grown-up halloween seemed pretty fun.
S27E04_1191#I saw an areola.
S27E04_1193#Oh, man, this is the lamest night
S27E04_1195#Of my entire miserable li...
S27E04_1199#Yes!
S27E04_1201#Everscream terrors is back!
S27E04_1206#Stop it, stop it, this will scare Lisa.
S27E04_1215#My brave girl.
S27E04_1217#I burned Tailee.
S27E04_1223#Foolish Simpsons.
S27E04_1225#This was not their typical halloween experience.
S27E04_1228#Wow, cool alien voice, Lenny.
S27E04_1230#Thanks, I've been practicing it. As a mat...
S27E04_1233#Oh, damn it, I lost it.
S27E05_50#*Who craves your soul within*
S27E05_52#*He's hungry for your vitals*
S27E05_54#*He likes you moist and ripe*
S27E05_56#*And should he find you spiced with sin*  
S27E05_58#*Then you're his favorite type*
S27E05_60#*He'll chew your juicy insides*  
S27E05_62#*Masticate you till you're pulp*  
S27E05_64#*Every little soul he'll swallow*  
S27E05_66#*With a stinky-ass gulp.*

S27E05_110#14!
S27E05_112#We have a winner!
S27E05_115#14 spins, and Wendell threw up!
S27E05_117#I didn't throw up, I held it in.
S27E05_121#No winner!
S27E05_123#House keeps the money!
S27E05_127#Oh, man, I got to see this.
S27E05_138#Mr. Largo?
S27E05_140#Something's wrong.
S27E05_142#That music is in tune.
S27E05_146#Hello, Bart.
S27E05_148#Sideshow Bob!
S27E05_149#'Twas I who texted you!
S27E05_151#Using Milhouse's phone.
S27E05_153#Did you know his wallpaper is American Girl doll?
S27E05_157#Now let me put this in terms any young boy would understand:
S27E05_159#you and I have danced a grand pas de deux

S27E05_164#But this is the final plie!
S27E05_166#Yawn. You couldn't kill me with that thing
S27E05_168#if I drew an "X" on my forehead.
S27E05_170#*Bob and his spear gun* 
S27E05_172#*Sittin' in a tree*
S27E05_174#*S-U-C-K-I-N...*  
S27E05_177#Nice try, Bob,
S27E05_179#but I'm sure you made some stupid...

S27E05_183#Not this time.
S27E05_186#Tell my father...

S27E05_645#He is foolish!
S27E05_646#So foolish!
S27E05_650#Doesn't mean you are not special.
S27E05_684#Now I have all eternity to talk to you.

S27E05_817#Ah, thank you.
S27E05_821#So, the key to this movie is it's so cheap! It's funny.

S27E06_165#Trying to make friends.
S27E06_168#Well, I've got news for all of your clubs:
S27E06_172#at 3 p.m., so Willie's turnin' on the sprinklers!
S27E06_177#Guys,
S27E06_178#I need your advice.
S27E06_180#Season three of anything is the best.
S27E06_181#Agreed.
S27E06_183#But I wanted advice for something else.
S27E06_185#It's something I really need for my well-being,
S27E06_188#but I just don't have the bucks.
S27E06_190#The thing everyone's doing these days,
S27E06_192#by which I mean a couple of years ago,
S27E06_194#is to get money through crowdfunding.
S27E06_195#You thought about that?
S27E06_197#Yes, but what is it?
S27E06_199#Crowdfunding is when lots of people
S27E06_201#give you small amounts of money
S27E06_203#to help your passion project come to life.
S27E06_205#Thanks to crowdfunding, we have Makey Makey computers,
S27E06_207#the 3Doodler pen,
S27E06_209#and Zach Braff's generation-defining dud
S27E06_210#"Wish I Was Here."
S27E06_212#Well, if there's anything
S27E06_214#that has true wisdom, it's crowds.
S27E06_222#Hello, friends.
S27E06_224#Are you sick of "Big Charity" asking you for money,
S27E06_227#with its free return envelopes
S27E06_229#and annoying black tie dinners?
S27E06_231#Well, I'm here to ask you
S27E06_233#for something different.
S27E06_234#Something simple.
S27E06_236#You can help a man get back on his feet.
S27E06_239#Dad, what are you recording?
S27E06_240#Ooh, Lisa.
S27E06_242#Turn to camera and quickly say "Please give."
S27E06_243#Please give.
S27E06_244#Give what?
S27E06_246#Uh, Lisa... eh, well, we'll fix that in post.
S27E06_250#He didn't even have the money to fix that in post.
S27E06_253#That is the saddest thing I've ever seen.
S27E06_258#Well, I suppose I could spare a little
S27E06_259#for my neighboreeno.
S27E06_261#Will you shut up, Flanders?!
S27E06_263#Lip zipped.
S27E06_266#I don't give handouts
S27E06_267#to poor people.
S27E06_269#It's not in the spirit of self-made Americanism,
S27E06_273#as espoused by Russian weirdo Ayn Rand.
S27E06_278#Dang it!
S27E06_279#We did it, friends.
S27E06_280#Made our goal.
S27E06_282#And now, to reveal the miracle
S27E06_284#that you all made happen...
S27E06_287#That's right.
S27E06_289#You bought me this chair.
S27E06_291#My ass was just lifted
S27E06_293#by a thousand angels.
S27E06_294#We bought him a chair?
S27E06_296#That lazy lump!
S27E06_298#After I finish this beer and have a nap,
S27E06_301#I may just call him.
S27E06_303#You gave money to this idiot?
S27E06_305#It was from my separate bank account.
S27E06_307#What separate account?
S27E06_309#I only use it to pay for my separate phone.
S27E06_312#You have a separate phone?
S27E06_316#Up, down,
S27E06_318#up, down.
S27E06_320#Up, down...
S27E06_322#up, down.
S27E06_323#Good!
S27E06_324#You feel the burning in your core?
S27E06_326#Oh, yes, I do.
S27E06_334#Homie, answer the door!
S27E06_336#For the first time in my life,
S27E06_337#I'd be happy to!
S27E06_342#Spend my money on a chair, sir?
S27E06_344#You're a lazy, bald monster.
S27E06_345#Don't be alarmed, there, Homer.
S27E06_347#We're just gonna calmly and gently
S27E06_349#destroy that chair!
S27E06_350#No way.
S27E06_351#My chair is now protected by a human shield.
S27E06_358#Take that, you idiot!
S27E06_363#Lisa...
S27E06_365#the crowdfunding video you costarred in
S27E06_367#is causing a lot of problems.
S27E06_369#The what-what I what-whatted in?
S27E06_371#Burn that chair!
S27E06_373#Burn that chair!
S27E06_374#- Burn that chair! - Wait a minute.
S27E06_375#That's not the chair.
S27E06_382#No tip!
S27E06_398#Guess a guy like me
S27E06_400#is never gonna get the finer things in life.
S27E06_402#What's the point?
S27E06_403#Aw, you poor thing.
S27E06_405#I've never seen you this unhappy lying down.
S27E06_407#Dad?
S27E06_409#Can you take me to a concert with my new friend Harper?
S27E06_412#Her dad got us the seats.
S27E06_413#Sure, why not?
S27E06_415#It'll be nosebleed or obstructed view seats.
S27E06_418#That's all a self-pitying guy like me ever gets.
S27E06_420#Who's the band?
S27E06_422#They're an adorable Australian boy band,
S27E06_424#and you can't really understand what they're saying.
S27E06_426#But who cares?
S27E06_428#I understand.
S27E06_430#That's how I felt about Crocodile Dundee.
S27E06_432#I will never forgive you
S27E06_434#for making us see that third movie.
S27E06_447#Music in a sports arena.
S27E06_449#The acoustics are gonna be a joke.
S27E06_451#Two tickets for Homer Simpson.
S27E06_452#Here you go...
S27E06_455#and here are your platinum V.I.P. wristbands.
S27E06_458#What the...? V.I.P.?
S27E06_460#Oh, this is never coming off!
S27E06_462#Just like the one
S27E06_464#from the last great day in my life.
S27E06_466#Oh, those muffins.
S27E06_470#And it's all thanks to Harper's dad.
S27E06_472#Who is this guy?
S27E06_479#Mi hijo queria ver esto,
S27E06_481#pero no puedo arrastrarla a mi show.
S27E06_484#Yes, yes, yes.
S27E06_491#The only platinum band I have
S27E06_493#is the one that's holding my skull together.
S27E06_495#Um, through that door.
S27E06_499#Remember when we were A-list?
S27E06_501#It all went south for me when I got that D.U.I.
S27E06_503#and said all those things I secretly believe.
S27E06_507#Doe-eyed Boys!
S27E06_509#Where? Where?
S27E06_511#Maybe one of these four little wimps will tell me.
S27E06_513#Answer me, wimps!
S27E06_514#That's them.
S27E06_515#The band.
S27E06_517#Hi. I'm Bindi,
S27E06_519#and this is Boz, McQuarrie and Wodonga.
S27E06_522#Wodonga.
S27E06_523#I'm afraid you don't belong here.
S27E06_525#Your wristbands are platinum with stripes.
S27E06_527#You belong...
S27E06_529#in there, braddah!
S27E06_535#Oh, my God!
S27E06_537#Oh, I wish I could tell you guys

S27E06_601#I know that guy.
S27E06_603#Yeah, sure you do, Uncle Lenny.

S27E06_720#Bam!
S27E06_728#Did I make $80 million?

S27E06_732#Well, he still might!
S27E06_733#Not today.
S27E06_736#Wow, Mike's daughter seems really great.
S27E06_738#Yeah, but it was weird.

S27E06_751#The world is full of wonderful, priceless experiences,
S27E06_754#and I can't give you any of them.
S27E06_757#But this girl can.
S27E06_759#So it doesn't matter if she talks to you,
S27E06_761#looks at you
S27E06_763#or is disrespectful to your father.
S27E06_766#She is your best friend.
S27E06_769#Mm, I don't know.
S27E06_774#Huh, Harper just invited us to go see David Copperfield.
S27E06_776#Oh, my God!
S27E06_778#That's something only tourists in Vegas get to do!
S27E06_783#Did you ever sit in the back of anything?
S27E06_785#Just the space shuttle, man.
S27E06_788#My one regret is I was too drunk to drive.
S27E06_791#Bam!
S27E06_792#Bam on that one.
S27E06_794#Okay, ladies, would each of you tell me
S27E06_796#your favorite TV show and dessert.
S27E06_798#Certainly, my favorites are The Happy Little Elves...
S27E06_800#Krusty and cotton candy.
S27E06_801#I was gonna say what my...
S27E06_804#Sorry, that's too long without me talking.
S27E06_808#So what do I do now?!
S27E06_809#Don't worry. Harper?
S27E06_811#What's your favorite starving wild animal?
S27E06_812#Crocodile?
S27E06_817#What's the trick here?!
S27E06_820#I'm so happy.
S27E06_823#Marge, do you know what it's like
S27E06_825#to have a man take care of your every need?
S27E06_828#I've thought about it a lot, but no.
S27E06_830#How come you're so quiet?
S27E06_832#Did he switch your brain with a rabbit's?
S27E06_834#'Cause that means somewhere there is one annoying rabbit.
S27E06_836#Shut up.
S27E06_838#I just keep thinking about the way Harper cut me off.
S27E06_841#It's kind of weird.
S27E06_843#Yeah, that was kind of weird.
S27E06_845#I'd have said something for sure,
S27E06_847#but my mouth was full of truffle popcorn.
S27E06_851#Mike just invited our family
S27E06_853#to spend next week on their private island!
S27E06_855#Wow, a whole week.
S27E06_857#Too bad the kids have school.
S27E06_858#Marge, please.
S27E06_860#Lisa's not gonna fall behind
S27E06_862#and Bart's not gonna catch up.
S27E06_864#We do not want our kids spoiled.
S27E06_866#Yeah, okay.
S27E06_868#Maybe this is where this thing should stop.
S27E06_878#Hello?
S27E06_880#This is Principal Seymour Skinner.
S27E06_882#We're calling parents, starting with you,
S27E06_884#to let them know that school has been canceled next week.
S27E06_887#Hmm, did that rich dad buy you off?
S27E06_891#Seymour Skinner is not for sale.
S27E06_897#The bread is in the oven.
S27E06_900#Lisa, Lisa, wait!
S27E06_902#I'm so glad you guys are coming with us.
S27E06_903#So...
S27E06_905#I got you a friendship present.
S27E06_910#A new bike?
S27E06_912#Uh, that's so nice of you.
S27E06_915#35 gears, Tiffany crystal bell.
S27E06_919#And the latest anti-theft device.
S27E06_922#You're not Lisa Simpson.
S27E06_924#Okay, what's the story?
S27E06_925#This we show up for.
S27E06_927#Harper, this bike is wonderful.
S27E06_930#Too wonderful.
S27E06_932#It just wouldn't be right for me to accept it.
S27E06_935#You'd rather have your crappy bike?
S27E06_937#Look, Harper, this may be crappy,
S27E06_939#but it's my bike.
S27E06_941#My dad assembled it on Christmas day.
S27E06_943#Which is why I have to pedal backwards to go forwards.
S27E06_946#But still, I love this!
S27E06_948#Uh, I didn't realize getting you the best bike
S27E06_950#you ever saw would make you so mad.
S27E06_953#I'm not mad, I just think this is...
S27E06_954#Just what?
S27E06_956#Don't appreciate what I did for you?
S27E06_958#Why do you always interrupt me like that?
S27E06_960#- That's not how friends... - Uh, I think I know how friends are.
S27E06_962#How would you like it if I 
S27E06_963#-I could've been friends with anybody-- - interrupted you all the time?
S27E06_964#- Janey, Sherri, , - You wouldn't like it all, would you?
S27E06_965#- Terri - No, you wouldn't.
S27E06_967#- Hubert Wong, Wendy Wang. - Interrupt, interrupt, interrupt,interrupt! 
S27E06_968#- That girl with freckles - Could you please,  just for once
S27E06_970#- only on one side of her face. - not interrupt me?!
S27E06_972#Whoa, sweet bike.
S27E06_973#You can have it!
S27E06_974#Even sweeter.
S27E06_976#As soon as I put some training wheels on this,
S27E06_978#I'll be the coolest kid ever.
S27E06_982#Oh! Too fast!
S27E06_990#You can put that stuff away, 'cause the trip is off.
S27E06_993#Well, where are we going with Harper?
S27E06_995#Nowhere, 'cause we're not friends anymore.
S27E06_1010#You owe me a Caribbean vacation, Lisa!
S27E06_1012#St. Croix or better.
S27E06_1014#Lisa, sweetie, I just want to understand.
S27E06_1016#You got in a fight with her
S27E06_1018#because she tried to give you a new bike?!
S27E06_1021#But she was so condescending!
S27E06_1023#Yeah, she was "Kinda sending" you a new bike.
S27E06_1025#Can you all please get out of my room?
S27E06_1031#Let's not let our little girls'
S27E06_1032#not liking each other
S27E06_1034#stand in the way of their being friends.
S27E06_1036#Come to the island, man.
S27E06_1037#We have everything there,
S27E06_1039#except for trunks your size-- ha!
S27E06_1041#You still want us to come?
S27E06_1043#Oh, kids fight all the time.
S27E06_1045#They're not in control of themselves like we are.
S27E06_1047#Damn, that is a beautiful sunset!
S27E06_1049#Damn! Damn! Aah!
S27E06_1052#Whew, now we'll meet you on the island
S27E06_1054#and the only problem will be the sand in our whatevers.
S27E06_1060#Sweetie, we really appreciate this.
S27E06_1062#And your brother, well, he's...
S27E06_1064#Where is your brother?
S27E06_1065#Hey, a whale.
S27E06_1066#Oh, it's Homer.
S27E06_1070#Oh, I'll show you!
S27E06_1073#Hey, sharks, here's some chum!
S27E06_1080#Welcome to Jambowski Island.
S27E06_1081#Formerly Haiti.
S27E06_1087#I'm really glad you came, Lisa.
S27E06_1088#Thanks for having us.
S27E06_1090#Now, Homer, I got you a special surprise.
S27E06_1093#A beach lift chair!
S27E06_1095#The laziest thing there is.
S27E06_1130#Suckers!
S27E06_1141#*Underneath the mango tree*
S27E06_1144#*Me honey and me can watch for the moon*
S27E06_1148#*Underneath the mango tree*  
S27E06_1152#*Me honey and me make boolooloop soon*  
S27E06_1156#Harper flipped a sea turtle on its back!
S27E06_1158#My beach, my turtle!
S27E06_1160#Why is everything yours?!
S27E06_1162#Oh, why do you kids have to argue all the time?
S27E06_1165#'Cause she wants things her way
S27E06_1167#instead of the right way.
S27E06_1169#Homer, help me out here.
S27E06_1172#No, no, with the girls.
S27E06_1174#Just tell your kid to let my kid have her way this time.
S27E06_1176#And every other time.
S27E06_1178#Dad...
S27E06_1180#I think you have a choice to make here.
S27E06_1190#It's time I stood up for myself.
S27E06_1196#Harper, I know I shouldn't say this on your private island,
S27E06_1199#but you're kind of spoiled.
S27E06_1201#That's right.
S27E06_1203#You don't deserve Lisa.
S27E06_1205#There's nothing I love more than her.
S27E06_1207#She's the sun, the moon and the other thing to me.
S27E06_1209#Thank you.
S27E06_1211#And we don't have to be on the same island
S27E06_1213#with people who push my little girl around.
S27E06_1214#Let's go, Marge.
S27E06_1216#Now? I just got up.
S27E06_1218#Now, please!
S27E06_1219#If you leave this island,
S27E06_1220#you're not taking the yacht.
S27E06_1221#Oh, no.
S27E06_1223#You're taking a limo to the private jet,
S27E06_1225#which is flying you straight home.
S27E06_1227#Then so be it.
S27E06_1237#I know how you feel, buddy.
S27E06_1241#Oh, I better sit down. Where can I sit?
S27E06_1246#Dad, what you said was really nice.
S27E06_1249#And believe me, we are much better off
S27E06_1251#off that island.
S27E06_1252#I know.
S27E06_1254#Goodbye crystal clear lagoon.
S27E06_1257#Good riddance, pink sand beach.
S27E07_104#*Band camp calls tonight*  
S27E07_107#*My demo goes online*
S27E07_111#*Tonight*  
S27E07_127#*Tonight, tonight* 
S27E07_130#*My dreams come true tonight* 
S27E07_133#{\an8}*Deposit's due tonight* 
S27E07_133#{\an8}*I'll take the pot tonight* 
S27E07_133#*I'll eat fondue tonight*
S27E07_133#*I'll spike your brew tonight* 
S27E07_136#*Tonight!*  
S27E07_141#Moe, what the hell is that?!
S27E07_143#Sorry. I missed rehearsal.
S27E07_145#Damn it.
S27E07_147#Marge, I'm heading out! Poker night!
S27E07_150#I don't want you losing all our scrimpings!
S27E07_153#Don't worry, Marge.
S27E07_155#The real excitement for me is staying within a budget.
S27E07_158#This is just a friendly game, right?
S27E07_161#Oh, super friendly.
S27E07_163#Suckers.
S27E07_164#Dad, Dad, Dad.
S27E07_166#I need two things: a good-night hug and a favor.
S27E07_169#To save time,
S27E07_171#I'll start describing the favor.
S27E07_173#I've just been accepted to the best band camp
S27E07_175#this side of the Mississippi!
S27E07_176#Which side are we again?
S27E07_178#Doesn't matter! It's a great camp.
S27E07_180#Notable graduates include Pete Barbutti.
S27E07_182#Pete Barbutti?!
S27E07_184#Yes! Anyway, it's a little pricey.
S27E07_186#So, if you win big tonight,
S27E07_188#maybe you could help make a little girl really happy.
S27E07_191#Don't worry, sweetie, I'm gonna win.
S27E07_193#And you know why?
S27E07_196#I'm wearing my lucky T-shirt.
S27E07_199#It was such a shame
S27E07_201#he lost to President Garfield.
S27E07_205#Oh, I'll fix this.
S27E07_209#There.
S27E07_214#The maestro is here.
S27E07_217#Hey, who's the lady?
S27E07_218#What, are you kidding?
S27E07_220#This is Laney Fontaine, Broadway legend.
S27E07_222#She starred opposite Al Pacino
S27E07_224#in Does a Tiger Wear A Necktie?
S27E07_227#Now I date Moe.
S27E07_229#He's got everything I look for in a man:
S27E07_231#a current liquor license.
S27E07_232#Well, it and you
S27E07_235#are the two most precious wrinkled yellow things I know.
S27E07_246#Three of a kind beats two pair.
S27E07_248#Straight beats three of a kind.
S27E07_250#Three beats two.
S27E07_251#Four beats three.
S27E07_258#Oh, my God.
S27E07_259#Full house.
S27E07_263#We're gonna win! That means Lisa goes to band camp.
S27E07_266#As long as Homer doesn't let them know
S27E07_268#how good his hand is.
S27E07_270#Then he'll blow the whole damn thing to hell!
S27E07_272#That would be terrible.
S27E07_275#Worst jammed-in movie parody ever.
S27E07_277#Come on, Homer. Poker face.
S27E07_282#Aah! Stupid git!
S27E07_284#I raise, no calls, pot goes to me.
S27E07_287#Hold on, Fat Folds Five.
S27E07_290#I see your raise, and I raise this.
S27E07_294#Is that real?
S27E07_295#Won it for cinematography.
S27E07_297#Invented a new kind of Steadicam that's mounted on a dog.
S27E07_300#That's five grand to you.
S27E07_304#So, are you in, or are you...
S27E07_308#While I'm out, no one look at my cards or my boobs.
S27E07_312#Aw. Don't she black out like an angel?
S27E07_314#Queens beat jacks.
S27E07_316#No one heard that. I'm in.
S27E07_325#Okay, Homer. Moment of truth.
S27E07_330#Oh, four of a kind! Hey, honey, you won!
S27E07_333#I lost.
S27E07_335#I lost everything.
S27E07_338#We're gonna celebrate, Moe.
S27E07_340#What's Springfield's version of Sardi's?
S27E07_341#Uh, Hardee's.
S27E07_343#I know a nice booth under a picture of a hamburger.
S27E07_346#Aw, come on, Homer. I'll drive you home.
S27E07_351#Hey, off we go!
S27E07_353#Vroom, vroom, vroom.
S27E07_358#You've completed Poker: A Beginner's Guide.
S27E07_360#Now go out there and win.
S27E07_363#I bid two bucks.
S27E07_379#What was that?
S27E07_381#Those aren't the tiptoes of a successful gambler.
S27E07_384#How much did you lose?
S27E07_386#$5,000.
S27E07_389#Whoa, I never heard that noise.
S27E07_393#I'm just sayin', doesn't look like
S27E07_395#band camp is in the cards.
S27E07_404#Hey, this is my thing now.
S27E07_408#So easy.
S27E07_409#Guys, I need help with a plan.
S27E07_411#Hey, what about a reverse mortgage?
S27E07_413#I saw a commercial for one where an old lady gave a thumbs-up
S27E07_416#and it turned into money, which filled up the screen.
S27E07_418#The entire screen?
S27E07_419#Swear to God.
S27E07_422#Hey, Homer, here's a thought: invite Laney over for dinner.
S27E07_425#Show her your crummy home, your unhappy kids.
S27E07_428#Anyone with a heart would take pity.
S27E07_430#Finally, my sucky life pays off.
S27E07_431#Do you guys think she'll buy it?
S27E07_434#Oh, yeah. Your whole house, uh, it smells like a basement.
S27E07_436#I've always hated your rugs.
S27E07_437#Yeah... whoa, whoa, whoa.
S27E07_439#Why you have to go there, man?
S27E07_440#He has such beautiful floors.
S27E07_442#Why must he hide them? Why?
S27E07_444#There I am,
S27E07_445#on the main stage at Caesar's,
S27E07_447#about to sing "Do You Love Me,"
S27E07_449#when who do I see sitting in the wings?
S27E07_452#Your boyfriend King Tut?
S27E07_454#No. Jack Jones.
S27E07_456#High on his success from "Wives and Lovers"
S27E07_458#with eyes for yours truly.
S27E07_461#But you'd just accepted a proposal from Mike Connors.
S27E07_464#Which I broke off.
S27E07_466#Let's just say Mannix was the one man
S27E07_468#I had to nix.
S27E07_471#Oh, that's rich!
S27E07_472#Oh, my God.
S27E07_474#That's going in your book.
S27E07_475#Please tell me you're writing a book.
S27E07_479#Sit down, boy.
S27E07_480#We're trying to show this dame
S27E07_482#that we're deserving of her pity.
S27E07_483#Where's that crutch I gave you?
S27E07_485#There's nothing wrong with my leg.
S27E07_486#There will be.
S27E07_487#D'oh!
S27E07_489#Ow, my leg!
S27E07_493#Oh! Oh, my leg.
S27E07_499#Who would take $5,000 from such a miserable creature?
S27E07_505#Laney, I know it's your night off,
S27E07_507#but would you like to sing a song for us?
S27E07_509#You don't have to ask me twice.
S27E07_512#*I'm just a Broadway lady*
S27E07_519#*Dancing on my aching feet*
S27E07_524#*Avoiding any foods with wheat*
S27E07_527#*And no drinking pre-show*
S27E07_532#*It's okay if the producer don't know*
S27E07_543#You know your way around a horn, kid.
S27E07_545#Oh, listen, I don't want to gush,
S27E07_547#but I have all your albums.
S27E07_548#Laney Sings The Blues,
S27E07_549#Electric Laney Land,
S27E07_551#Laney Butchers The Beatles.
S27E07_553#Ooh, and my favorite,
S27E07_555#Rehab Yourself A Merry Little Christmas.
S27E07_557#I'll tell you what, Marge.
S27E07_559#I'll wipe the slate clean on one condition.
S27E07_561#I want you to give Lisa to me.
S27E07_565#Uh, for a month or so.
S27E07_570#I see.
S27E07_572#Get out. I never want to see you again.
S27E07_574#Let me explain.
S27E07_576#Listen, lady, you can't take a daughter
S27E07_578#from a mother unless you're a bigger star
S27E07_581#and this is a third-world country.
S27E07_582#Marge,
S27E07_583#I know this sounds nuts,
S27E07_585#but I never had the joy you have.
S27E07_587#A child to hug me at the end of the day
S27E07_589#or-or a chance to pass along what I know.
S27E07_591#I'm going out on tour,
S27E07_593#and she's got all the makings of a star:
S27E07_595#talent, smarts and a star-shaped head.
S27E07_598#Perhaps you didn't hear me.
S27E07_600#Here's your coat.
S27E07_602#Mom, mom.
S27E07_603#Mom, please.
S27E07_605#You were gonna let me go to band camp for a month,
S27E07_608#where people break curfew and exchange reeds.
S27E07_611#But this? This is the opportunity to live my dream.
S27E07_614#Come on, how many chances in life do you get for that?
S27E07_616#None!
S27E07_619#I've been here, I've just been quiet.
S27E07_630#I guess I can't deny you this.
S27E07_631#All right.
S27E07_633#Oh, thanks, mom!
S27E07_635#And, mom, if you have any doubts how a showbiz kid will turn out,
S27E07_637#just look at all of them!
S27E07_644#Mom, I appreciate this so much.
S27E07_646#You'll be the first person I thank at the Tony's
S27E07_648#after the great Angela Lansbury.
S27E07_650#Bye.
S27E07_663#Good night, kid.
S27E07_666#Would you read to me before I go to bed?

S27E07_670#I did the audiobook on this.
S27E07_672#If chapter ten sounds like it was Peter Falk,
S27E07_674#it's because it was.
S27E07_676#So I guess you don't want to read it again.
S27E07_679#How 'bout I give you some showbiz advice?
S27E07_682#Every piece of advice someone gives you
S27E07_684#will turn out to be wrong.
S27E07_687#Particularly wrong are people like me who seem knowledgeable.

S27E07_695#You watching Channel Six right now?

S27E07_722#I wanted an audition,
S27E07_724#not a recital. You're in, kid.
S27E07_725#I made it in Hartford.
S27E07_731#- Are you sure you set it up right? - Yes!
S27E07_734#Then why aren't we Skyping?
S27E07_736#I don't know. Maybe Lisa's drugged-out.
S27E07_738#My daughter is not drugged-out.
S27E07_741#Maybe she's just sleeping late after partying at discotheques.
S27E07_743#How do you know about all-night discotheques?
S27E07_746#We have Disco Stu in this town, Mom.
S27E07_749#He's a resource. Use him.
S27E07_753#How are you, sweetie?
S27E07_754#I'm good, I'm good.
S27E07_756#What happened to your voice?
S27E07_757#I don't know.
S27E07_759#Late rehearsals, cheap root beer.
S27E07_763#But I'm great! We're heading to New York!

S27E07_768#Sonny and Stix.
S27E07_772#Do I hear syncopation?
S27E07_774#Lisa, Lisa, I was thinking maybe you could
S27E07_776#come home a little early and...
S27E07_778#I'm sorry. I got to go. Our take five is over,
S27E07_780#and jazz is all about following the rules, you know.
S27E07_783#Come on, guys. Don't I get a puff?
S27E07_788#I really have the munchies.
S27E07_791#Bye!
S27E07_793#We've got to get her back.
S27E07_795#Pack your things. We're heading for New York.
S27E07_797#We should get a place there. We go so often.
S27E07_810#I can't believe I'm gonna be performing here.
S27E07_821#I already got my ticket!

S27E07_953#Hey, Laney.
S27E07_955#Moe, I need you.
S27E07_957#To make me feel confident, strong and beautiful.
S27E07_960#Boy, I'm not real good at boosting self-esteem there.

S27E07_1099#It did, and it was wonderful.
S27E07_1102#Eh, she's been bitten by the showbiz bug.
S27E07_1104#And when that happens, only working with Bruce Willis

S27E07_1151#Mom, suddenly I really want to go home.
S27E07_1156#If you go, let me give you one huge piece of advice:
S27E07_1158#take the Eighth Avenue side,

S27E08_132#Amelia Vanderbuckle? Who's she?
S27E08_135#Ah, she was Springfield's original lady inventor.
S27E08_138#Why have I never heard of her?
S27E08_140#Well, totally nuts.
S27E08_142#She made a mess of everything.
S27E08_145#Easy, girly, don't go Vanderbuckle on us.
S27E08_155#"Amelia Vanderbuckle lived in Springfield
S27E08_157#"In the 1800s.
S27E08_159#"She was the middle child of a family of 17.

S27E08_175#I'm trying to pour ants in this doll.
S27E08_177#"Among other things, she was the proud inventor

S27E08_196#I want one!
S27E08_198#"A medical board diagnosed Amelia
S27E08_201#"With acute feminine overreachism and she was--

S27E08_209#"But Amelia never gave up,
S27E08_211#"Continuing to work as an inventor

S27E08_217#Bart, if we find those inventions,
S27E08_219#we can prove that Amelia was scientifically significant.
S27E08_221#Pass.
S27E08_221#Listen to me.
S27E08_223#I need to prove this woman was not a lunatic
S27E08_225#so people will not giggle when they hear the words
S27E08_228#"Woman scientist."
S27E08_230#"Woman scientist."
S27E08_232#What's next-- boy cigarette girl?
S27E08_235#Let me ask again.
S27E08_237#Will you help me break into an abandoned insane asylum?
S27E08_242#Abandoned asylum, where have you been all my life?

S27E08_251#Oh, come on, Bart.
S27E08_253#Or this door.
S27E08_255#Bart!
S27E08_264#The ghosts of a thousand lunatics are making me hot.

S27E08_311#Good evening.
S27E08_313#Because I am not taken seriously due to my gender,
S27E08_316#a friendly guard has hidden my invention
S27E08_318#until a future time, when some liberated young woman
S27E08_321#has the permission of her husband to look for it.
S27E08_324#There's a whole closet of these things!
S27E08_326#How many magicians do they have in this place?
S27E08_328#Find my journal, and it will lead you

S27E08_362#Guys, did you ever read something
S27E08_364#and think it was written just for you?
S27E08_366#Behold... the diary of Nathan Little!
S27E08_372#"I pushed a vagabond under a trolley."
S27E08_374#What's a trolley?
S27E08_375#Old-timey subway.
S27E08_377#- What's a vagabond? - Homeless guy.
S27E08_382#What's a homeless guy?

S27E08_389#Tap class!

S27E08_400#Ralphie, what is going on here?
S27E08_402#Bart made us read pages from a scary diary.
S27E08_406#I was so a-scared, sour juice came out my front tail.
S27E08_411#Bart wrote this? This is bad.
S27E08_413#Ooh, really bad.
S27E08_415#I don't think we're gonna make it to...
S27E08_417#tap class.
S27E08_421#- Chief Wiggum? - Your son is dead...
S27E08_423#...inside.
S27E08_427#That's bad, too.
S27E08_429#Yeah, these are pages from your son's diary.
S27E08_431#I'm afraid they very clearly show him to be...
S27E08_434#a sociopath.
S27E08_437#Hm. Well, I've never seen Bart write in cursive,
S27E08_439#so I'm a little proud of that,
S27E08_441#but this is the worst thing
S27E08_443#that's ever happened to this family.
S27E08_444#I-I'm sorry, Marge.
S27E08_446#And... shuffle off,

S27E08_449#shuffle off.
S27E08_455#Homie, I've learned something terrible about Bart.

S27E08_461#Chief Wiggum found these pages from our son's diary!
S27E08_464#Oh, I've had a long day.

S27E08_471#"Someone who can't feel empathy or guilt.
S27E08_474#They do terrible things and don't care who it hurts."
S27E08_478#Don't answer that!
S27E08_479#It could be Bart!
S27E08_481#- Bart has a key. - What?! Who gave him a key!
S27E08_484#Hey, Mrs. Simpson.
S27E08_485#Can Bart come over
S27E08_486#and see my grandfather's collection
S27E08_488#of Japanese swords and throwing daggers?

S27E08_499#Wow, this is a surprise.
S27E08_501#I'm usually sweating when we talk, but not this time.
S27E08_505#It's amazing how you can charm and disgust me at the same time.
S27E08_507#That's just what happens
S27E08_509#when I'm with the prettiest girl in town.
S27E08_515#Amelia's journal tells us
S27E08_517#that her invention is buried in the basement

S27E08_531#let's just say there's a mystery about him.
S27E08_534#The Suffragette Society was right here.
S27E08_540#Oh... here?
S27E08_543#Hey, sweetie, you looking for your mom?
S27E08_545#I'll find her-- just, uh, give me her cup size.
S27E08_547#Actually, we're here because your basement
S27E08_549#is home to a landmark of feminist history.
S27E08_551#Do you mind if we poke around?
S27E08_553#The basement, eh? Yeah, that's where
S27E08_555#we wash the ketchup off the old onion rings.
S27E08_558#- So no. - These guys want a children's menu?
S27E08_560#Nah, they're just leavin'.
S27E08_562#Seriously, kids, I got to switch ten TV's

S27E08_572#Okay, I found a test online

S27E08_578#We can't just give Bart
S27E08_580#something labeled "Sociopath Test"!

S27E08_614#We want to know if you meet the clinical definition

S27E08_622#"I enjoy manipulating other people."
S27E08_624#"I believe I'm being followed."
S27E08_626#"Sometimes I feel as if I must injure myself or someone else."
S27E08_629#Agree, agree, agree.
S27E08_632#"Sociopath."
S27E08_633#What's that?
S27E08_640#That's what they think I am?
S27E08_642#Fine! I'll pretend to be the biggest sociopath in the world!
S27E08_645#And I only need to change three answers.
S27E08_647#- Is he nuts? - I don't know.
S27E08_649#- What do you think? - I mean, he looks nuts,
S27E08_651#that's for sure.
S27E08_653#So, here's your test.
S27E08_655#Call me crazy, but I enjoyed it.
S27E08_662#Well, the good news is that Bart just got
S27E08_664#his first 100% ever on a test.
S27E08_667#Oh, my God. What do we do?
S27E08_669#Whatever Bart wants.
S27E08_671#*Crazy*
S27E08_675#*But that's how it goes*
S27E08_679#*Millions of people*
S27E08_682#*Living as foes*
S27E08_685#*Maybe*
S27E08_689#*It's not too late*
S27E08_693#*To learn how to love*
S27E08_696#*And forget how to hate*
S27E08_701#*Mental wounds not healing*
S27E08_704#*Life's a bitter shame*
S27E08_707#*I'm going off the rails*
S27E08_710#*On a crazy train*
S27E08_715#*I'm going off the rails on a crazy train*
S27E08_728#- Thanks. - My pleasure.
S27E08_730#Anything to take down Knockers.
S27E08_731#I've always hated them,
S27E08_733#because they wouldn't open up at 4am
S27E08_736#to show the World Caber Tossing Championships.
S27E08_739#Okay, Willie, you can only use the jackhammer
S27E08_741#when there's lots of noise upstairs.
S27E08_742#No worries.
S27E08_744#It is Monday Night Football,
S27E08_747#by which I mean American football,
S27E08_749#by which I mean no football at all!
S27E08_753#There's the box!
S27E08_758#Ow! Medium spicy!
S27E08_760#Ach! We've hit the hot sauce supply line!
S27E08_764#I'll have to neutralize it with some signature blue cheese!
S27E08_771#Look at me! I'm a sociopath!
S27E08_774#Marge, it's time we did something.
S27E08_776#We can take him swimming. That makes him sleepy.
S27E08_779#Not good enough. We have to call the number
S27E08_781#at the bottom of the test.
S27E08_782#What number?
S27E08_785#- Right there. - "New Beginnings"?
S27E08_787#We're gonna trust our son to an 800 number?
S27E08_790#It's 888.
S27E08_792#Marge, this is for his own good.
S27E08_793#He failed an online test.
S27E08_795#How much more proof do you need?
S27E08_803#Surprise! Surprise!
S27E08_805#Whoa, cool! But wait a minute,
S27E08_807#my birthday's not for another two months.
S27E08_809#We know! But we wanted to have your party now!
S27E08_813#They were having a sale on pinatas and...
S27E08_816#one thing led to another so we, you know,
S27E08_819#had a thing, mumble, mumble, mumble... mumble...
S27E08_821#Well, where are my friends?
S27E08_823#Well, I was gonna mail out invites,
S27E08_826#but I was out of stamps and the post office line was long,
S27E08_829#and I didn't know where all the little...
S27E08_831#Well, more cake for me.
S27E08_833#No, no, no, no. Do the Moon Bounce first.
S27E08_835#Yes! The Moon Bounce!
S27E08_838#Don't want you throwing up this delicious cake.
S27E08_868#Wait a minute. What is this?
S27E08_869#Is it an asylum?
S27E08_870#No, it's a pizza parlor.
S27E08_872#Please tell me, Dad, is it really a pizza parlor?
S27E08_875#No, son-- the pizza parlor is where your mom and I
S27E08_878#are going afterwards. Now, you're gonna be fine.
S27E08_881#I wouldn't be surprised if you were the least messed-up kid
S27E08_883#in the whole joint. We love you!
S27E08_887#Wait, wait, wait! I didn't even get to say good-bye.
S27E08_890#Good-bye! I'll never forgive you!
S27E08_893#There. You happy?
S27E08_898#Let me out! I was just playing a joke!
S27E08_900#A cruel joke on the people that love me! That I don't regret!
S27E08_903#That doesn't make me a sociopath!
S27E08_904#Children,
S27E08_907#form a line in order of medication
S27E08_909#from Adderall to Zoloft.
S27E08_915#You have been brought here for a purpose.
S27E08_916#You are fearless,
S27E08_917#and no one can stop you.
S27E08_919#Which means you'll be of great use...
S27E08_921#to the U.S. Military.
S27E08_925#I expected more of a reaction.
S27E08_927#I waited outside the door and everything.
S27E08_929#They don't react. That's what we want.
S27E08_931#Right.
S27E08_933#We'll be using you in the ultimate video game
S27E08_936#to test these U.S. Air Force drone simulators.
S27E08_940#Man, that is a tough crowd.
S27E08_945#Mom, Dad, I've discovered the most amazing thing!
S27E08_948#I can't wait... Um, where's Bart?
S27E08_950#He's safe. And more importantly, we're safe.
S27E08_954#I miss him so much.
S27E08_959#Oh. Can I call him?
S27E08_961#You can call his guard, Tico.
S27E08_962#He picks up sometimes.
S27E08_963#I see.
S27E08_965#Okay, I'll do that.
S27E08_967#Homie, where did we go wrong?
S27E08_970#I don't know, sweetie. I don't know.
S27E08_973#We did everything we could for him during the commercials.
S27E08_975#And we're live

S27E08_991#Thank you all for coming out
S27E08_994#to support a woman's place in history!
S27E08_996#That's what this is?
S27E08_998#I thought it was a Green Bay Packers rally.
S27E08_1001#All right, you know what, this ain't coming off.
S27E08_1004#Behold, the masterpiece of Amelia Vanderbuckle.
S27E08_1008#A loom?!
S27E08_1009#That isn't science.
S27E08_1011#That's home economics.
S27E08_1013#Everyone, storm the stage!
S27E08_1014#Not so fast!
S27E08_1016#This is no ordinary loom!
S27E08_1018#Even an extraordinary loom
S27E08_1020#is the most boring thing I could think of.
S27E08_1023#This is much, much more than just a loom.
S27E08_1042#It's alive! And polite!
S27E08_1046#"Operand"? Looks like it wants us to give it a math problem.
S27E08_1059#Oh, my God. Oh, God!
S27E08_1061#It's the first computational device!
S27E08_1062#People, people, don't you see?
S27E08_1064#The board acts like punch cards
S27E08_1066#and the loom like a computer,
S27E08_1068#with the Charles Babbage and the John Von Neumann...
S27E08_1072#Let's have the square root of nine cheers for Lisa!
S27E08_1079#Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!
S27E08_1083#You see that, Bart? You see what your sister did?
S27E08_1085#Yeah, yeah, great.
S27E08_1087#Listen, I'm in a simulator,
S27E08_1089#so I can't really talk.
S27E08_1090#And you know I'm a sociopath,
S27E08_1092#so I'm just going through the motions here.
S27E08_1093#I love you.
S27E08_1094#I was just saying that to myself.
S27E08_1100#Have a smart bomb, stupid.
S27E08_1103#Nice not knowin' ya.
S27E08_1104#All targets destroyed.
S27E08_1106#Simulation complete.
S27E08_1110#You are impressive.
S27E08_1112#Even though I'm the only real person in the world,
S27E08_1114#and, therefore, I created you in my imagination.
S27E08_1117#Children, your empty souls and flying fingers
S27E08_1120#are very impressive, and I can tell you now
S27E08_1122#that was no simulation.
S27E08_1124#You mean we were blowing up real stuff?
S27E08_1127#That's right-- convoys, terrorist training camps,
S27E08_1130#suspicious weddings, Kabul Starbucks.
S27E08_1133#Cool! Awesome. I knew it!
S27E08_1135#No, I thought it was a video game.
S27E08_1137#I don't want to hurt real people.
S27E08_1139#Oh, I want to go home.
S27E08_1141#Please?
S27E08_1142#How disappointing.
S27E08_1144#Does anyone else share the human boy's feelings?
S27E08_1147#Son, the truth is the simulators we told you
S27E08_1151#weren't simulators were simulators.
S27E08_1154#Now, I'm sorry, Bart,
S27E08_1156#but you are a healthy, normal boy.
S27E08_1158#We're sending you home.
S27E08_1160#Really? Oh, wow. Dudes, it's been real.
S27E08_1162#Although, actually, it was all a fake.
S27E08_1164#I'll never forget you, Bart Simpson.

S27E08_1174#My little guy is back!
S27E08_1177#And I'm not bad! I just made bad decisions.
S27E08_1180#It's okay, boy.
S27E08_1182#You started out life as a bad decision.
S27E08_1185#The best bad decision I ever made.
S27E08_1191#And I restored the reputation
S27E08_1193#of a scientist from 100 years ago.
S27E08_1198#And Maggie tried strawberries for the first time.
S27E08_1202#What a day! What a day!
S27E08_1210#Okay, Lisa, go ahead and say it.
S27E08_1211#Don't be ashamed.
S27E08_1213#I'm immortal!
S27E08_1215#...immortal!
S27E08_1218#Hey, Madam Docent, want to come see?
S27E08_1220#Oh, I'd love to, but there's a huge crowd here
S27E08_1223#at the Science of Thor exhibit.
S27E08_1226#Hey, tour! Want to see a great invention and its plaque?
S27E08_1229#We're just passing through to the cafe.
S27E08_1230#Double-time, tour.
S27E08_1233#How 'bout you, sir?
S27E08_1235#Je Ne parle pas l'Anglais.
S27E08_1237#Pas de problme. Je parle franais!
S27E08_1239#Uh, leave me alone, little girl!
S27E08_1248#Okay, pal, if you are indeed a personal computer...
S27E08_1256#Oh, baby. Spin that yarn.
S27E08_1258#Now, that is a loom with a view.
S27E08_1260#Homie! Come help me carry the groceries!
S27E08_1262#Yeah!
S27E08_1264#Clear history, clear history.
S27E08_1266#Just working on your anniversary present.
S27E08_1269#I know this looks like nothing,
S27E08_1271#but it's actually bad.
S27E09_73#Do it again, boy.
S27E09_75#I bet he can't control it.
S27E09_81#Bart, you shouldn't...
S27E09_84#Maybe one more.
S27E09_95#Want to play cars?
S27E09_99#Oh, boy, if I go down there, I ain't coming up.
S27E09_102#My dad won't play cars with me, either.
S27E09_104#Calm down, Melvin Q. Mopenheimer.
S27E09_107#There's other ways of playing cars.
S27E09_110#Feast your eyes on the most beautiful machine ever made:
S27E09_114#the 1954 Studebaker Starliner Commander!
S27E09_117#I bought it brand-new

S27E09_121#Can I sit in it?
S27E09_124#Well, I don't know how you expect to drive it
S27E09_126#if you ain't sitting in it.
S27E09_128#Grampa! I can't drive.
S27E09_129#Neither can I, legally.
S27E09_131#Now let's get going!
S27E09_138#You know you can season these things
S27E09_140#with pepper spray, don't you?
S27E09_143#I need water in my eyes.
S27E09_149#Let's open her up a little.
S27E09_155#Homer never showed such spirit.
S27E09_157#You got gumption, boy.
S27E09_159#I wish this day would never end.
S27E09_160#Aw, sorry, Bart.
S27E09_162#Time don't stop.
S27E09_163#The years go by
S27E09_165#and you don't even realize it.
S27E09_178#Grampa, I told you to get him home by 5:00.
S27E09_181#His tutor's here to teach him to read.
S27E09_183#When I was a boy,
S27E09_186#I ain't never did not need no tutor either no how!
S27E09_188#Yes, sirree, ain't!
S27E09_190#"S-See... the...
S27E09_195#"See the mouse.
S27E09_197#"Mouse hits cat.
S27E09_198#Cat goes splat."
S27E09_200#Very good, Lisa.
S27E09_201#Very, very good!
S27E09_203#And with barely any knowledge of diphthongs, 
S27E09_205#sibilants and phonemes.
S27E09_210#How come she can read and I can't?
S27E09_211#All right, calm down, young man.
S27E09_213#Not to worry, you won't need to read.
S27E09_215#You see, customers will just point to a picture
S27E09_218#of the burger that they want you to flip.
S27E09_221#Because you're not gonna have anything going.
S27E09_225#Very nice painting, Lisa.
S27E09_228#We're putting it right over the couch.
S27E09_229#I made a drawing, too!
S27E09_231#It's on the refrigerator!
S27E09_232#And the wall.
S27E09_233#And the curtains.
S27E09_240#Boy, you've ruined our kitchen!
S27E09_242#Do you understand?
S27E09_244#This is a place of pork chops.
S27E09_247#But... do you like my drawing?
S27E09_249#Homer, please, please.
S27E09_251#Just say something positive.
S27E09_254#Well, it's a...
S27E09_255#colorful example of...
S27E09_257#something that...
S27E09_259#ruined our kitchen!
S27E09_261#I can't even find the fridge!
S27E09_262#You're not beer.
S27E09_264#Where is it?
S27E09_265#And who are you?
S27E09_267#We're playing hide and seek.
S27E09_268#I'm Milhouse.
S27E09_270#Milhouse? What kind of a wiener name is that?
S27E09_272#A very bad one, sir.
S27E09_277#That boy is so much trouble.
S27E09_279#Never should have had a firstborn.
S27E09_282#Should've skipped right to the second.
S27E09_285#There's one thing I can do better than you.
S27E09_288#I've finished painting the wall
S27E09_290#and it's better than new.
S27E09_292#In some ways, this was kind of a bless...
S27E09_297#I got gumption!
S27E09_299#Bart's disruptive behavior
S27E09_301#is probably caused by his feeling
S27E09_302#that you think other children
S27E09_304#are more deserving of attention.
S27E09_306#Mm, I see.
S27E09_308#And how can we help these other children?
S27E09_310#We're here for Bart.
S27E09_312#- In a boy like Bart... - Yeah?
S27E09_314#...the attention he craves most is from his father.
S27E09_315#Good luck with that.
S27E09_317#Take him camping!
S27E09_318#I do want to help him, I do.
S27E09_320#And your son is just looking for your love.
S27E09_323#For a psychologist,
S27E09_325#you sure know how to get into people's heads.
S27E09_327#And I brought my flashlight
S27E09_329#so we can find our way in the dark,
S27E09_331#and my scissors to cut wood into kindling,
S27E09_333#and an air horn to scare away bears.
S27E09_343#Wh... why are we stopping?
S27E09_345#This is where we're camping, son.
S27E09_346#I thought we were going to stay
S27E09_348#in a tent in the woods.
S27E09_350#Like the kids that got killed
S27E09_351#in that movie you took me to.
S27E09_354#Son, the woods this time of year are very outdoorsy.
S27E09_356#But we'll do fun things.
S27E09_358#Oh, listen! Do you hear that?
S27E09_361#It's the sound of an ice machine.
S27E09_364#Great.
S27E09_365#Come on, let's go hunt...
S27E09_367#for the registration desk.
S27E09_371#Andreychuk passes ahead to Hamilton...
S27E09_372#it's too far in front...
S27E09_374#and the ref waves off the icing.
S27E09_377#The TV is north of the bed.
S27E09_379#Better hit the hay, son.
S27E09_380#Learning this new remote
S27E09_382#really took something out of me.
S27E09_384#Never saw a menu button colored green before.
S27E09_388#Crazy buttons.
S27E09_391#So, how was
S27E09_392#your camping trip with your father?
S27E09_393#Okay.
S27E09_395#We got lots of Starwood points at the hotel.
S27E09_399#Oh, my thrifty pioneers.
S27E09_402#Lisa, how was school?
S27E09_404#The teacher gave me this.
S27E09_407#"Student of the month"!
S27E09_409#How long have you been in that school?
S27E09_410#A month.
S27E09_411#I've been there two years
S27E09_413#and no one ever gave me anything!
S27E09_417#Aw, poor kid.
S27E09_419#Are you taking his dessert?
S27E09_421#Yes, I am.
S27E09_422#Up to him.
S27E09_427#Are you eating that cake?
S27E09_428#What? No.
S27E09_432#Son, I know it may not seem like it now,
S27E09_434#but you're gonna be glad
S27E09_436#to have a sister when you grow up.
S27E09_438#You're always gonna like her better than me.
S27E09_440#That's not true.
S27E09_442#I love you both the same amount: 40%.
S27E09_445#Gotta leave room in the budget.
S27E09_447#Then will you put this on your car?
S27E09_450#I'll be proud to.
S27E09_462#Ooh, both those bumper stickers mean so much to me.
S27E09_475#Happy birthday!
S27E09_477#Well, thanks.
S27E09_479#But you know I'm not into Krusty anymore.
S27E09_482#You've outgrown Krusty?
S27E09_484#First no more "Ay, caramba," Now this?
S27E09_485#Mom, don't have...
S27E09_486#Have a cow, man?
S27E09_487#I was gonna say
S27E09_489#"Don't have a foolish attachment to the past."
S27E09_490#Come on, boy.
S27E09_491#Humor your mother.
S27E09_493#Oh, fine.
S27E09_495#Don't have a cow. Man.
S27E09_500#Oh, my God!
S27E09_503#I'm Student of the Month for 48 consecutive months!
S27E09_506#Great, honey, great!
S27E09_508#But, you know, it is Bart's birthday.
S27E09_511#No, no, no, this is fine.
S27E09_513#Just let me fix this.
S27E09_514#There.
S27E09_516#Now it's all about you.
S27E09_517#Happy?
S27E09_519#I'll go get him.
S27E09_521#Oh, it's no use.
S27E09_523#He's walking kind of fast.
S27E09_533#Hey, you missed one.
S27E09_535#Nope, can't do it, my Grampa lives there.
S27E09_537#Stop! Stop right there!
S27E09_539#Well, looks like we finally put an end
S27E09_541#to this light-mare on Elm Street.
S27E09_545#Actually, it's Maple Street, Chief.
S27E09_547#Thank you, joke police.
S27E09_549#Please don't arrest me.
S27E09_551#It's a victimless crime!
S27E09_553#Oh, I can't see!
S27E09_559#Looks like a case of Molemanslaughter.
S27E09_562#Did that sound right to you, Lou?
S27E09_564#I like it.
S27E09_568#Thanks for letting me hide here, Grampa.
S27E09_569#Hiding?
S27E09_570#This is the best visit I've had in months!
S27E09_580#Now, come get your birthday present.
S27E09_583#I've been asking my parents for this,
S27E09_585#but they said I'd break my neck.
S27E09_587#Hey, you're gonna break your neck sometime.
S27E09_589#It's important you do it when you're young.
S27E09_590#Like chicken pox.
S27E09_593#Now get out before I say something else preposterous.
S27E09_607#Mom, it's just the Mayo Clinic Pre-Medical Summer Camp.
S27E09_610#I would've been totally fine on my own.
S27E09_612#No more discussion.
S27E09_614#Our cab's here.
S27E09_616#Ooh, it's one of those new Apple cars.
S27E09_621#Really think they should've stuck with computers.
S27E09_623#Have a great trip.
S27E09_625#Don't you worry.
S27E09_627#I'll take good care of our little guy.
S27E09_628#I'm 15!
S27E09_632#Oh, our big boy's getting cranky.
S27E09_636#Homer, this summer may be your last chance
S27E09_638#to have a close relationship with your son.
S27E09_641#Don't blow it.
S27E09_645#So, boy, look at this.
S27E09_648#Just us guys, huh?
S27E09_651#Glad we've got the whole summer,
S27E09_653#'cause we got a lot to talk about.
S27E09_654#Yeah, I guess.
S27E09_655#Let's see.
S27E09_659#When you replace windshield wipers,
S27E09_661#you only need to switch out the rubber part,
S27E09_663#not the whole blade.
S27E09_665#Huh, where can you buy just the rubber part?
S27E09_666#I don't know.
S27E09_669#Well, I'm glad I told you that before I died.
S27E09_671#So, uh, I'll go to Moe's while you sort it out, huh?
S27E09_687#Yes!
S27E09_692#Hey, thanks for coming.
S27E09_695#After washing dishes for a year they bumped me to prep,
S27E09_697#which means I draw up the schedule, babe.
S27E09_700#Wow, no more Mr. Minimum Wage.
S27E09_702#I didn't say that.
S27E09_704#So I just got out of juvie for the streetlight thing.
S27E09_706#But I'm not mad.
S27E09_708#I've learned that the greatest crime of all
S27E09_711#is a life without faith.
S27E09_714#What's wrong?
S27E09_716#Is the cross not big enough?!
S27E09_723#Wow, you make out just like Terri said you do.
S27E09_725#Wait, you're not Terri?
S27E09_727#No, I'm Sherri.
S27E09_728#But the further we go,
S27E09_730#the more you'll know the difference.
S27E09_735#Oh, weed.
S27E09_737#That can get me into a lot of trouble.
S27E09_741#Hey, idiots, the bong stays in the tree house!
S27E09_743#Hey, boy.
S27E09_747#Are you crazy?
S27E09_749#What if the cops come?
S27E09_754#You're here, too?
S27E09_756#Yeah, must be weird for you.
S27E09_759#And-and think about this, man--
S27E09_761#the whole world is happening right now.
S27E09_764#I mean, India, China.
S27E09_766#It's crazy.
S27E09_767#Can you just leave me here with my dad?
S27E09_769#All right, sure.
S27E09_771#I can fly!
S27E09_773#No, no, I can't!
S27E09_775#I can't!
S27E09_778#Dad, why is it you and I are never on the same page?
S27E09_782#Officer down, man.
S27E09_784#Boy, when you arrived, I was terrified.
S27E09_787#Because it meant I wasn't a kid anymore.
S27E09_790#I had responsibilities.
S27E09_792#Truth is, I'm just like you.
S27E09_794#A misunderstood guy who wants his family to love him.
S27E09_798#And maybe we could start with a hug?
S27E09_802#Aw, I'm so glad we're sharing this.
S27E09_805#And I'm glad I have one kid who's never
S27E09_808#gonna go anywhere or do anything.
S27E09_809#Damn it, Homer!
S27E09_811#You ruin everything!
S27E09_821#Grampa, got to talk to Grampa.
S27E09_830#Grampa, I sure miss you, man.
S27E09_832#What would you say if you were here right now?
S27E09_837#If you ever get a chance to pitch woo at Myrna Loy, take it!
S27E09_840#She has eyes like a Persian cat.
S27E09_842#Of course in my day, Persia extended
S27E09_844#from Algiers to Constantinople.
S27E09_848#Till the revolt of the eunuchs in 1916 when...
S27E09_851#Ooh, you got gumption, kid.
S27E09_854#Find what you love and follow it to glory.
S27E09_856#Yes.
S27E09_861#So, we're headed into the final round
S27E09_863#of the Duff Extreme BMX vert competition.
S27E09_866#Let's check the scoreboard
S27E09_868#while the half-pipe is being cleaned by the Blood-Zoni.
S27E09_872#Dad, one more round and I win!
S27E09_874#First achievement I can call my own.
S27E09_876#Thank God whatever this thing is
S27E09_878#is considered a sport.
S27E09_880#Bart Simpson to the gate, please.
S27E09_883#Oh, good, we're just in time.
S27E09_886#It's not the size of the pennant.
S27E09_888#It's what you do with it.
S27E09_892#All right, nobody likes a showoff.
S27E09_899#Oh, man, I love to see this.
S27E09_901#Simpson's setting up for his signature
S27E09_903#suicide no-hander 540 crank-flip!
S27E09_921#I'm doing it! I'm doing it!
S27E09_922#Finally, I'm me.
S27E09_924#Finally out of Lisa's shadow.
S27E09_928#No!
S27E09_933#Yes! Yes!
S27E09_935#Thank God I aced chest compressions
S27E09_937#at Mayo pre-med camp!
S27E09_939#And Bart's okay!
S27E09_941#The real star of this BMX tournament is
S27E09_943#Lisa Simpson!
S27E09_945#Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!
S27E09_948#You've ruined everything I've ever done!
S27E09_950#Move, quick!
S27E09_951#No!
S27E09_954#Warned you.
S27E09_959#Biker, huh? I used to bike.
S27E09_961#I used to have dreams.
S27E09_963#I used to think disco was coming back.
S27E09_965#Now I'm just Stu.
S27E09_967#Nothing Stu.
S27E09_970#Hey, Bart, you are coming to my graduation party tonight?
S27E09_973#I don't know, man. It's humiliating.
S27E09_975#My little sister's graduating the same year as me.
S27E09_980#Nelson, how can you say that with what's happened to you?
S27E09_983#Yeah, well, I bought a totally bitching car
S27E09_987#with the money I got selling my pituitary gland.
S27E09_991#So cool.
S27E09_1001#I knew I'd break down when Kearney Jr. graduated.
S27E09_1004#It's okay, Dad.
S27E09_1006#We still got K-3.
S27E09_1010#Right.
S27E09_1012#Ralph, you joined the army?
S27E09_1015#Yes, because I needed a costume for this party.
S27E09_1018#At college I'm gonna reinvent myself.
S27E09_1020#I'll pretend I have a girlfriend in Canada.
S27E09_1024#I'll say she lives in Alberta and her name is Alberta,
S27E09_1027#so I don't have to remember two lies.
S27E09_1031#Bart!
S27E09_1032#I was getting worried.
S27E09_1033#I'm your oldest buddy.
S27E09_1035#I was there when you got your nose done,
S27E09_1037#then I was there when you had your nose undone.
S27E09_1040#Friends, family, and a few people we hired
S27E09_1043#to make our son look more popular...
S27E09_1045#I love Milton!
S27E09_1047#Dad, you're embarrassing me!
S27E09_1049#As usual.
S27E09_1051#Yes, it's the only thing your father does well.
S27E09_1054#Can't you two put it aside for one night in honor of me?
S27E09_1057#No!
S27E09_1061#Ah, what the heck?
S27E09_1062#Congratulations, Milhouse.
S27E09_1065#You made it through adolescence and you're cuter than ever.
S27E09_1069#Oh, sweet Lisa!
S27E09_1071#You know I had a rocky childhood
S27E09_1072#with all the rocks they threw at me.
S27E09_1075#You're the most amazing thing at this party.
S27E09_1078#Well, excuse me!
S27E09_1082#I'm not even the best Simpson at my best friend's party!
S27E09_1085#Do you know what it's like to be second-best at anything?
S27E09_1087#Yeah, I do!
S27E09_1089#I'm going to Yale!
S27E09_1090#Listen here, Bart Simpson!
S27E09_1092#I am sick and tired of you blaming me
S27E09_1094#for every setback you have ever had!
S27E09_1097#And you have talents, too, you idiot.
S27E09_1099#You're a hell of an artist,
S27E09_1101#even though you don't do anything with it.
S27E09_1103#You think I'm an artist?
S27E09_1106#And you already have a true artist's most important asset.
S27E09_1108#A miserable life.
S27E09_1111#So if that's all my fault, you're welcome.
S27E09_1136#Hey, man. You're looking good.
S27E09_1138#Thank God Lisa invented the artificial pituitary.
S27E09_1140#Sorry, didn't mean to use the "L" Word.
S27E09_1143#Listen, man, a certain someone convinced me
S27E09_1146#to go around giving back the lunch money I took.
S27E09_1148#Here's the first $5,000.
S27E09_1152#Thanks. What got into you?
S27E09_1153#Nelson, come on!
S27E09_1156#We'll miss day six of the Bolivian Film Festival.
S27E09_1158#You guys are dating?
S27E09_1159#Is there any other reason I'd be going
S27E09_1161#to a Bolivian Film Festival?
S27E09_1164#I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Bart.
S27E09_1166#I don't really know how you feel about me.
S27E09_1168#Well, you told me I was an artist, and you were right.
S27E09_1171#I am, and
S27E09_1173#I get to write on the walls.
S27E09_1175#Wow, that's beautiful.
S27E09_1178#I do notice there's no me.
S27E09_1180#Ah, those are the breaks.
S27E09_1182#Why don't I buy you and your boyfriend a couple beers?
S27E09_1184#Just let me close up.
S27E09_1185#That would be nice.
S27E09_1186#We'll see you at the car.
S27E09_1193#You weren't supposed to see.
S27E09_1195#Well, I'm glad I did.
S27E09_1202#You're El Barto?
S27E09_1204#How is that possible?
S27E09_1216#Why are clouds brown?
S27E09_1217#Pollution.
S27E09_1219#Why is the grass green?
S27E09_1221#'Cause it's artificial.
S27E09_1224#Then why are the sprinklers coming on?
S27E09_1226#'Cause I was too lazy to unhook them.
S27E09_1229#Why aren't we moving?
S27E09_1231#Because you're drunk and I'm stoned.
S27E09_1235#Why does beer taste so good?
S27E09_1237#'Cause you've just had seven.
S27E09_1239#Did you like the movie Boyhood?
S27E09_1241#Oh, is that what this was?
S27E09_1243#How many years of hair do I have left?
S27E09_1246#It disappears as soon as girls like you.
S27E09_1248#What's the secret of life?
S27E09_1251#You can avoid a lot of awkward situations
S27E09_1254#by pretending to be on the phone.
S27E09_1255#Like what?
S27E09_1256#Hold on, I got to take this call.
S27E11_169#Shoulder-mounted anti-tank missile. Duh.
S27E11_172#Did you ever American sniper someone?
S27E11_176#That's really not appropriate for me to say.
S27E11_180#How many hospitals did you help build?
S27E11_182#Negative three.
S27E11_184#Oh, my god, I've got a cool teacher.
S27E11_186#What am I doing? I'm sitting up straight,
S27E11_188#And my hands are folded like a nerd.
S27E11_189#I've got to fix that.
S27E11_190#Yes?
S27E11_192#Now one's up in the air.
S27E11_195#Okay, let's show this innocent young veteran
S27E11_199#what happens when you call on Bart Simpson.
S27E11_201#Ma'am, my name is Bart,
S27E11_204#and I just want to say how delighted I am that you're here.
S27E11_207#What the hell?
S27E11_209#Thank you, Bart.
S27E11_213#A neck tat?
S27E11_215#Milhouse, have you ever thought a teacher was cute?
S27E11_217#Oh, yeah. I thought Krabappel was smokin'.
S27E11_220#I kept every issue of the Fourth Gradian she was in.
S27E11_223#Great lady.
S27E11_226#*Pretty sober*
S27E11_229#*I've only got one beer inside me*
S27E11_233#*Pull me over*
S27E11_236#*My blood alcohol is .03*
S27E11_240#Oh, I like it when the drivers sing their blood alcohol level.
S27E11_243#*Not so sober*
S27E11_246#*So drunk I'll eat gas station sushi.*
S27E11_250#Homer, don't forget to pick up milk.
S27E11_252#?And not just any milk--
S27E11_254#Healthy milk, without any hormones.
S27E11_257#I won't forget.
S27E11_261#Aw, they sell ads in thought bubbles now?
S27E11_265#I'm running a basic errand.
S27E11_268#Homer Simpson buying a healthy product?
S27E11_271#Now I have seen all of the things that there are to see.
S27E11_274#That will be $16.
S27E11_276#And can I interest you in any, uh, milk insurance?
S27E11_279#$16?! 
S27E11_282#Another case of the rich cows sticking it to the little guy.
S27E11_286#Okay, don't worry. We're going to get you into a milk today.
S27E11_291#I like it's in a plastic bottle
S27E11_293#that'll be around for millions of years.
S27E11_294#But is it good for my kids?
S27E11_296#I know you have concerns.
S27E11_299#But this video will gloss over all of your questions.
S27E11_301#It'd better.
S27E11_306#- How's that milk, Jimmy? - Boring.
S27E11_309#Now, we could engineer a new Jimmy who is less of a brat,
S27E11_312#but we'll just use science to jazz things up.
S27E11_317#We used to feed boring old grass to cows.
S27E11_320#That might have been fine for farmer Brown.
S27E11_322#But we brought in a next-gen blend of phenyl ketamine,
S27E11_325#Ketyl phenamine, and a healthy sprinkling
S27E11_327#of transuranic elements. 
S27E11_328#But don't worry,
S27E11_331#we still get the milk from good old-fashioned cows.
S27E11_343#That's the best milk I've ever had.
S27E11_345#You said "Milk."
S27E11_347#We can't, legally.
S27E11_349#I'm not the kind of guy advertising works on,
S27E11_352#but I'll take 20, no questions asked.
S27E11_360#Bart, you're up already?
S27E11_361#Don't want to be late for school.
S27E11_363#Hair combed, face washed?
S27E11_365#I thought I'd shake things up.
S27E11_368#Morning, Marge. Morning, Bart. 
S27E11_369#What the...?
S27E11_371#Is it a court day today? 
S27E11_373#Let's see.
S27E11_375#Nope, today we're off.
S27E11_378#The courthouse is closed because the judge is becoming a citizen.
S27E11_381#What gives, boy?
S27E11_383#Nothing's going on.
S27E11_384#Some days a boy just wants to look
S27E11_386#like he's going to church, okay?
S27E11_388#I'm the last one to breakfast?
S27E11_391#You guys are planning my birthday, right?
S27E11_393#'Cause last year's was kind of lonely.
S27E11_394#Boy, that's when I realized 
S27E11_396#just how big a bowling alley really is.
S27E11_400#Can we please get a move on? I do not want to miss any school.
S27E11_403#Could this punctual Bart possibly be connected
S27E11_406#to your cute new teacher?
S27E11_408#Do I have a cute new sexy teacher? I hadn't noticed.
S27E11_412#*Bart likes his teacher*
S27E11_414#*Bart likes his teacher*
S27E11_417#Nothing can turn a boy's life around like a cute teacher.
S27E11_420#Like what Michelle Pfeiffer did for Coolio.
S27E11_422#In fact, to be supportive, I'll drive Bart to school.
S27E11_425#Are you just trying to see how cute the teacher is?
S27E11_428#Or how handsome he is, Marge.
S27E11_430#Not a he, right, boy?
S27E11_431#No. ?
S27E11_438#Even my dad came back for this!
S27E11_441#That's right, son. But, uh, right after this,
S27E11_443#I have to go get some cigarettes.
S27E11_445#Last time, you never came back.
S27E11_447#Oh, don't cry, Norman.
S27E11_449#That's not my name!
S27E11_451#Oh, right. That's my other abandoned son.
S27E11_453#I have a brother!
S27E11_456#And just what are you doing?
S27E11_458#Putting the first new coat of paint on this school
S27E11_460#in 30 years.
S27E11_463#It's always good to have a joker in the platoon.
S27E11_466#Bart, according to your folder,
S27E11_468#you need some extra help.
S27E11_470#Can you meet me after class?
S27E11_472#No problemo. I can move my 3:30 freeze tag.
S27E11_474#Just cancel.
S27E11_477#Bart, I'm glad that you're trying,
S27E11_480#but I am worried that you're starting from a place
S27E11_482#far behind most students.
S27E11_487#It's because I am so troubled, ma'am.
S27E11_490#Vulnerable. I need a firm but pretty hand.
S27E11_493#Would you like Martin Prince to tutor you?
S27E11_496#No! Last time he was at my house,
S27E11_498#he talked about bird-watching all day.
S27E11_501#Even my mom got bored, and she loves boredom.
S27E11_504#Well, I guess I could see you Tuesdays after school.
S27E11_510#*Tuesday*
S27E11_514#*Afternoon*
S27E11_519#*I'm just beginning to see*
S27E11_523#*Now I'm on my way*
S27E11_527#*It doesn't matter to me*
S27E11_531#*Chasing the clouds away.*
S27E11_535#Uh, Ms. Berrera?
S27E11_538#I was, uh, wondering if you needed any help,
S27E11_540#pulling your maps.
S27E11_542#You have to give 'em a snap.
S27E11_544#Otherwise, they just get longer and longer.
S27E11_548#Oh, my god, he loves her, too.
S27E11_550#Oh, my god, he loves her, too.
S27E11_552#Oh, my god, they love me, too!
S27E11_555#That's right. In my head, I sound like this.
S27E11_560#No! No, no, no, no!
S27E11_562#What happened? Did jazz die?
S27E11_564#Look at me!
S27E11_567#Acne? But she's only eight.
S27E11_570#Somehow I'm becoming a squeaky-voiced teen!
S27E11_573#Do you want fries with that?
S27E11_575#What am I saying?!
S27E11_577#I, too, was visited by the ghost of puberty present.
S27E11_580#I've got a starter 'stache. Next, I'm a loser,
S27E11_583#Then I'm a creep, then I'm a perv.
S27E11_584#I've got to buy a van.
S27E11_587#This isn't fair.
S27E11_589#I'm not ready for my awkward years.
S27E11_592#This is my happy childhood, for crying out loud!
S27E11_596#Dialing for pizza.
S27E11_602#Somewhere, another mustache is in tremendous pain.
S27E11_605#It must be precocious puberty.
S27E11_609#It's a thing. I just read about it in Thing Magazine.
S27E11_612#Homer, I'll fix Lisa up,
S27E11_613#and you teach Bart to shave.
S27E11_616#You got it. But there will be blood.
S27E11_620#And there,
S27E11_622#there, and there.
S27E11_626#The cream looks delicious, but don't eat too much.
S27E11_629#And there. See how it's done, boy?
S27E11_630#Dad, aren't you supposed
S27E11_632#to take the little plastic thing off the blade?
S27E11_634#Really? I always wondered about that.
S27E11_642#Well, hello, Billy Zane.
S27E11_646#Sweetie, every kid goes through this.
S27E11_649#That's why proms are dark.
S27E11_653#Just stick some carrots in there three times a day.
S27E11_659#So we won't see your sweet little face for ten more years?
S27E11_663#Mom, the inside of this hoodie 
S27E11_666#is covered in tears.
S27E11_670#Let me try some makeup.
S27E11_673#- Cruelty-free? - Oh, yes.
S27E11_675#I'll be very gentle.
S27E11_677#Marge? Marge, you got to see this!
S27E11_679#Oh, what is it?
S27E11_688#I actually have two different PTSDs.
S27E11_690#The kind we combat veterans know.
S27E11_692#And, also, Parent- Teacher-Student Dilemmas.
S27E11_695#No!
S27E11_700#Bart!
S27E11_701#Do not worry.
S27E11_703#I am certified as a paramedic.
S27E11_710#Teacher, could you kiss my owie?
S27E11_714#Boy, owies can only be kissed by Willie.
S27E11_717#- Where's the owie? - I'm fine. I'm fine.
S27E11_722#Lisa, you look great!
S27E11_723#Beautiful and mature.
S27E11_725#Like a sideline reporter.
S27E11_727#R-Really?
S27E11_729#Didn't know you were so cool.
S27E11_733#Well, um, uh, well, duh.
S27E11_736#Oh, my God, I'm popular!
S27E11_739#Hope this doesn't go to my head.
S27E11_741#It went right to my head!
S27E11_743#So when you're done with this page, 
S27E11_746#you will learn how tectonic plates rub against each other
S27E11_749#till something gives deep down.
S27E11_753#You do not have to tutor this boy
S27E11_755#under the new One Child Left Behind law.
S27E11_756#But he needs help,
S27E11_758#and he's not going to be a child much longer.
S27E11_761#He's got a mustache coming in.
S27E11_763#Yeah, so beat it, bald lip.
S27E11_769#Oh, my God, I just got invited to my first third-grade party!
S27E11_772#Are the parents gonna be home?
S27E11_773#Yes. 
S27E11_774#Lame.
S27E11_776#Guys, I need to sharpen my mustaches.
S27E11_777#Which is better--
S27E11_779#A or B?
S27E11_781#A... or B?
S27E11_783#A or B?
S27E11_785#A... or B?
S27E11_786#-B. - A.
S27E11_787#N.
S27E11_790#I'm tired of my son having a mustache like a pool boy.
S27E11_794#those pool boys pull in some sweet jingle.
S27E11_797#Plus, they get to work in flip-flops.
S27E11_799#Homie, it's time we figured this out.
S27E11_801#Maybe milk will help us think.
S27E11_803#How would milk do that?
S27E11_805#It's from cows who are smart enough
S27E11_807#not to get turned into hamburger.
S27E11_812#I never looked closely at this milk before.
S27E11_814#Is it made by a soda company?
S27E11_816#They don't just make soda, Marge.
S27E11_818#They also make industrial foam.
S27E11_824#Homer, it's the milk!
S27E11_827#I'll call the help hotline on the carton.
S27E11_834#Talk to me.
S27E11_836#Yes, I need a milk refund.
S27E11_838#Right. Um, address, please?
S27E11_840#Wait, wait. Hold on.
S27E11_844#742 Nevergreen... 
S27E11_847#Oh, Evergreen Terrace. Sorry. 
S27E11_849#Our system's a little slow.
S27E11_862#I mean, cool!
S27E11_864#I just turned a big corner, Bart.
S27E11_871#Simpson,
S27E11_873#I called you here to gloat.
S27E11_875#Yeah, yeah, I know about you and Berrera.
S27E11_878#You know about me and Carol?
S27E11_880#You know her name?
S27E11_882#Oh, first and middle, and I know more.
S27E11_884#Her favorite salad bar item is little shredded cheese.
S27E11_887#Pff. Everyone likes that.
S27E11_888#Oh, I know a lot more than that.
S27E11_890#She's never seen an episode of Friends.
S27E11_892#Not even "The One with..."?
S27E11_893#No, not one.
S27E11_895#And she has a cat with different color eyes.
S27E11_898#His name is Bowie.
S27E11_900#No!
S27E11_902#Face it, Simpson: you can't compete with me.
S27E11_904#I can rent a car.
S27E11_908#How can I derail his happiness?
S27E11_911#I got a delivery of live class pets here.
S27E11_913#Interesting. Excuse me. I have one question.
S27E11_915#Yes.
S27E11_918#When you're in the shower, do you shampoo your mustache?
S27E11_922#Of course. It's a must-stache,
S27E11_924#not an if-you-feel-like-it-stache.
S27E11_925#All right, have a good day.
S27E11_927#Dickory doo.
S27E11_931#I brought you some candy, Carol.
S27E11_933#Not from CVS, not from Walgreens.
S27E11_935#From the airport.
S27E11_937#And I wasn't even going anywhere.
S27E11_941#Your candy's filled with chupacabras.
S27E11_943#We've been pranked or possibly punked.
S27E11_946#I know who your prankster is.
S27E11_948#The Simpson lad.
S27E11_950#Were you watching us make out?
S27E11_952#I was watching you try.
S27E11_956#Mom, could you please, please, please
S27E11_959#stay within the lip liner?
S27E11_962#A week ago, you'd never even worn makeup.
S27E11_964#Now you're an expert like Ace Frehley.
S27E11_974#Sherri. Terri.
S27E11_978#I usually don't see double until an hour into the party.
S27E11_982#It's going to rain,
S27E11_984#and rain washes off makeup,
S27E11_986#and then they will see me as I truly am--
S27E11_988#imperfect, blemished,
S27E11_990#a social mess in a lampshade dress.
S27E11_993#Okay, all right.
S27E11_995#Lisa, you were never popular,
S27E11_997#so you're playing with the house's money.
S27E11_999#Attention, party!
S27E11_1002#I'm not like you.
S27E11_1005#What I'm saying is, I gave my Christmas money to NPR.
S27E11_1008#I have a chemistry set... that I've used!
S27E11_1010#Is there a point to this?
S27E11_1012#And beneath all this makeup,
S27E11_1014#I have... problem skin.
S27E11_1021#What are you talking about?
S27E11_1023#Your skin is fine.
S27E11_1025#Really? The bad milk wore off.
S27E11_1028#So, uh, admitting you're not cool 
S27E11_1030#is probably the coolest thing you can do, right?
S27E11_1035#I will see myself out.
S27E11_1040#You look ba-lonely.
S27E11_1043#I feel ba-lonely.
S27E11_1045#- You want to be friends? - I do.
S27E11_1047#Um, how clean is that hand?
S27E11_1050#Cleaner now.
S27E11_1051#Okay.
S27E11_1054#A fish says, "Moo!"
S27E11_1056#This isn't gonna last long.
S27E11_1058#I still take baths in the sink.
S27E11_1060#Okay, it's over. Sorry, Ralph.
S27E11_1063#I'll be eating crayons for one.
S27E11_1071#The plan is perfect!
S27E11_1073#I just have to get Skinner to hold still
S27E11_1075#while I slip a firecracker in his butt.
S27E11_1077#Come on, give it up.
S27E11_1079#Bart, I realized what's been going on.
S27E11_1081#We've been operating under the influence of hormones.
S27E11_1084#Hormones? Sounds far-fetched.
S27E11_1086#Very far-fetched.
S27E11_1088#Well, it's true, so give Skinner a shot.
S27E11_1091#Everyone deserves happiness.
S27E11_1092#Even wieners.
S27E11_1099#Dad, how much does the Mustache Fairy pay?
S27E11_1102#Three bucks.
S27E11_1109#When you asked me to go skating, I really thought you knew how.
S27E11_1114#I thought I could learn by watching YouTubes this morning.
S27E11_1117#All right, Simpson, I'm here.
S27E11_1119#Do what you do best-- your worst.
S27E11_1121#Look, Seymour, I'm not gonna do a thing.
S27E11_1123#Carol, he's all yours.
S27E11_1126#The first war I've won.
S27E11_1128#Uh, Carol, all that's left is for you to meet my mother,
S27E11_1130#and, uh, up she skates now.
S27E11_1134#My son, I just want to say, I wish the four of you the best.
S27E11_1137#Four of us?
S27E11_1140#You, her, your model planes and nudie books.
S27E11_1142#Sorry, Seymour.
S27E11_1144#Now I can't look at you without picturing it.
S27E11_1147#Oh, my room's not that bad.
S27E11_1149#I'm talking about your mother.
S27E11_1155#Listen, want to roast marshmallows?
S27E11_1157#- I'd like that. - Great, man, great.
S27E11_1159#You're buying.
S27E11_1165#Thank you, Simpson.
S27E11_1167#That does feel better.
S27E11_1169#Fire looks like it's dying down.
S27E11_1173#Thanks, man.
S27E11_1175#Well, I guess a lot of women leave their men
S27E11_1177#to go back and serve in Afghanistan.
S27E11_1180#No one drives 'em away like you, Seymour.
S27E11_1188#Well, no more makeup for me. Ever!
S27E11_1191#What about when you're blowing your stupid horn 
S27E11_1192#at Carnegie Hall?
S27E11_1195#If you say it out loud, it won't come true!
S27E11_1198#Carnegie Hall. Carnegie Hall. Carnegie Hall.
S27E11_1205#Looks like someone's still drinking the milk.
S27E12_71#Can we? Can we? Can we?
S27E12_73#It's not gonna be as good as you think.
S27E12_74#Nothing ever is.
S27E12_75#But it gets us out of the house.
S27E12_77#Can we? Can we? Can we?
S27E12_79#Oh, wait, I'm me. Sure!
S27E12_85#This is my favorite part of the parade,
S27E12_88#coming to the kwik-e-mart to laugh at the losers
S27E12_91#who forgot to bring parade supplies!
S27E12_94#Which reminds me, we need parade supplies.
S27E12_95#Parade jerky.
S27E12_97#Get your parade jerky.
S27E12_98#Beef, turkey or pork.
S27E12_100#It all tastes like a delicious shoe tongue.
S27E12_103#Ah, one tube of sunblock.
S27E12_104#That will be $30.
S27E12_106#Once again, keeping the bald man down.
S27E12_109#I do have a Philadelphia 76ers hat
S27E12_111#that you could wear for free.
S27E12_112#I'll pay! I'll pay!
S27E12_114#Leading the parade
S27E12_116#is the new Jebediah Springfield statue
S27E12_117#that local wags have already dubbed
S27E12_119#"Quimby's folly."
S27E12_123#Er, uh, I am Jebediah Springfield,
S27E12_125#brought to you by Springfield Auto Lube.
S27E12_129#Chuck, Ernie, and Arturo are there for you.
S27E12_133#This ad was a bad call, man.
S27E12_136#And now, here comes our brand-new SWAT tank.
S27E12_139#This expensive urban pacification vehicle
S27E12_141#was funded by Homeland Security.
S27E12_144#Gaze in wonder at America's debt!
S27E12_148#We love you, officer puff 'n' stuff.
S27E12_152#Thank you!
S27E12_154#And now Springfield's true heroes,
S27E12_156#our volunteer fire department.
S27E12_158#Wait, what?
S27E12_162#This is the one good thing I do.
S27E12_167#*You're simply the best*
S27E12_171#Lousy chili cookers!
S27E12_173#Grabbing all our glory!
S27E12_174#All right, calm down, chief.
S27E12_176#I heard a couple of "Oohs" but that's it.
S27E12_182#Oh, that's grand theft thunder.
S27E12_186#Hey, cops, does SWAT stand for short, wide and tubby?
S27E12_189#I'm not sure, but I doubt it.
S27E12_200#All right, you pole-sliders asked for it.
S27E12_207#Chief, what are you doing?
S27E12_209#I'm gonna hit 'em so hard
S27E12_211#their dalmatian loses its spots, ha!
S27E12_214#Uh, they're-they're coming at us!
S27E12_216#Release our fiercest weapon--
S27E12_217#Foam.
S27E12_224#Who wants juice?
S27E12_225#Who needs juice?
S27E12_227#Nobody!
S27E12_229#I-I can't control this thing.
S27E12_230#Let me drive.
S27E12_232#Okay, okay, I'm stuck in a hole.
S27E12_233#Oh, we're headed for the kwik-e-mart.
S27E12_235#Someone call the police!
S27E12_237#Before I die, I would like to know
S27E12_239#just what is in these nudie magazines.
S27E12_241#What is it, brother?
S27E12_243#An interview with Jim Gaffigan.
S27E12_248#We are still alive.
S27E12_250#Oh, there is a gods!
S27E12_255#I didn't do it. Nobody saw me do it.
S27E12_256#You can't prove anything.
S27E12_258#You did do it, I saw you do it,
S27E12_259#and here's proof.
S27E12_263#What are y gonna do, man?
S27E12_265#You know what I'm gonna do?
S27E12_266#I'm gonna turn this in.
S27E12_268#You can rot in jail.
S27E12_270#The only time you'll come out is to see the dentist.
S27E12_272#No, you can't be serious.
S27E12_274#You know the kind of things they'll do to me at the dentist?
S27E12_276#Well, there's only one other way.
S27E12_279#You have to promise never to prank again.
S27E12_282#Come on, man.
S27E12_283#If I don't do these pranks soon,
S27E12_285#when I'm older they'll be crimes.
S27E12_286#Promise me!
S27E12_288#I promise.
S27E12_289#Say it like you mean it.
S27E12_290#I promise.
S27E12_292#Now say it like you're talking to a dying soldier
S27E12_295#who was with you all the way from D-Day,
S27E12_297#and you gotta take his saint christopher medal
S27E12_298#back to his mother.
S27E12_299#Take me there.
S27E12_301#I promise!
S27E12_303#Whoa, calm down, Pacino.
S27E12_308#Apu, it's good to see you doing so well.
S27E12_310#I know you can't turn your head,
S27E12_312#but you've got a great view.
S27E12_314#Are you okay?
S27E12_316#Marge, he's got nine lives.
S27E12_318#I am a Hindu, sir, not a cat.
S27E12_320#I have infinite lives
S27E12_322#during some of which I may be a cat.
S27E12_323#In those I do have nine.
S27E12_324#Apu, face it.
S27E12_326#Our store is ruined.
S27E12_328#This is painful, but I no longer want
S27E12_330#the customers to, "Come again."
S27E12_331#I want to work somewhere else.
S27E12_333#I see. Nurse!
S27E12_335#Transfer this man to the mental ward.
S27E12_336#Okay.
S27E12_338#Listen to me, when I was hit with the sign,
S27E12_339#that was a sign.
S27E12_340#I'm through.
S27E12_342#How can you abandon me, brother?
S27E12_344#Well, the way we abandoned our other brother.
S27E12_346#What other brother?
S27E12_348#All I remember on that boat was you,
S27E12_350#the tiger, and the wise, old fox.
S27E12_351#The... Oh, my god!
S27E12_353#The fox was actually Tikku.
S27E12_356#Oh, sweet, little Tikku, I blocked out the memory.
S27E12_359#Oh, no!
S27E12_360#Tikku!
S27E12_362#Yes, well, I have given 
S27E12_364#my share of the store to my son, Jamshed.
S27E12_366#He will rebuild while you recuperate.
S27E12_368#Little Jamshed.
S27E12_370#Oh, how he's grown.
S27E12_372#Indeed, first in his class with a business degree from Wharton,
S27E12_375#and he is ready to take my place de-gunking the cheese warmer.
S27E12_377#All right, my brother.
S27E12_380#I will especially miss looking into 
S27E12_384#your tired, sunken eyes during our wordless shift changes.
S27E12_385#Remember when we used to nod?
S27E12_387#I do, I do.
S27E12_390#It is down to just you and me now, store.
S27E12_392#Together, nothing can stop us.
S27E12_394#Unless they put another store within three blocks,
S27E12_396#which I hear they plan to do.
S27E12_400#And now to lower this photo to see what is really there.
S27E12_405#There, we gave him one last look at it.
S27E12_408#Roll away the photo.
S27E12_410#Quick & fresh?
S27E12_412#Who spells "Quick" With a "Q"?
S27E12_413#Hey, uncle Apu.
S27E12_414#Jamshed?
S27E12_416#Come on, man, Jamshed died at band camp.
S27E12_418#I'm Jay now.
S27E12_419#Yup. Check it.
S27E12_422#I just bitch-slapped your kwik-e-mart into the 21st century.
S27E12_425#An upgrade?
S27E12_426#No!
S27E12_432#I will just live in the happy past one moment longer.
S27E12_437#Disco Stu is in denial with you.
S27E12_443#Check it out, uncle A.
S27E12_444#I made this place healthy.
S27E12_446#I added softer lighting.
S27E12_448#We're even getting a better class of robber.
S27E12_450#I'm afraid I must relieve you of your spare cash
S27E12_452#and a nice bottle of gin.
S27E12_455#Ah, Mrs. Peel, shall we?
S27E12_458#Okay, those guys are cool,
S27E12_461#But still, Jamshed-- I-I'm-I'm sorry, Jay--
S27E12_463#I know my customers.
S27E12_465#All they want is something they can eat while driving.
S27E12_467#I'd like a heat lamp dog, please.
S27E12_469#Somewhere between two and six blisters.
S27E12_471#I'm sorry, we don't serve those anymore.
S27E12_473#They're a heart attack shaped like a penis.
S27E12_475#Why, you, millennial...
S27E12_476#Easy, brah.
S27E12_478#Check out our olive bar.
S27E12_484#Ha, see, he doesn't care what he eats.
S27E12_486#He just eats things in that location.
S27E12_488#Hey, quit talking like I can't hear.
S27E12_490#This is my store.
S27E12_491#Mine and Sanjay's.
S27E12_493#My father's enjoying his retirement.
S27E12_497#Bubba Watson!
S27E12_499#You are no Vijay Singh.
S27E12_502#Don't forget, my dad owned more of this place than you did.
S27E12_505#Oh, you, I can't... I...
S27E12_508#Okay, can we move this discussion into the restroom?
S27E12_511#you have a restroom?
S27E12_512#- No. - ?No.
S27E12_515#I saw the whole jam from my seat
S27E12_517#on top of the ATM machine.
S27E12_521#You know what, I'm not gonna scratch this last one.
S27E12_524#A smart man knows when to walk away.
S27E12_531#One paid-for ticket and all the rest were losers.
S27E12_534#They say don't scrape where you eat, but...
S27E12_537#That ticket won the biggest scratcher payoff
S27E12_540#in kwik-e-mart history.
S27E12_542#$25.
S27E12_545#Whoop, don't mind me.
S27E12_549#But that was the last winner he saw.
S27E12_552#He scratched and scratched, using...this.
S27E12_555#Is that the same dime?
S27E12_558#It started as a quarter.
S27E12_561#He was hospitalized briefly with scratcher's lung.
S27E12_565#Each time, he paid my dad back
S27E12_567#with another piece of the store.
S27E12_572#So, Sanjay-- and now I-- own 80%
S27E12_576#of the Quick & Ficky-fresh and rising...
S27E12_579#Come on, big bang theory scratcher.
S27E12_581#Bring me back to break even.
S27E12_583#Sheldon, Sheldon...
S27E12_585#Oh! Wolowitz.
S27E12_587#Always olowitz.
S27E12_591#Bart, Chalmers is sunbathing nude under a beehive.
S27E12_594#Sorry, man, I'm retired.
S27E12_596#Now to present my manhood to the sun.
S27E12_599#There he is.
S27E12_603#No more pranking.
S27E12_605#- But... ? -Do you know how much imagination
S27E12_608#it costs to appear in a thought bubble?
S27E12_610#Sorry, Milhouse, can't.
S27E12_612#And you know what? A little part of me is glad
S27E12_615#that Chalmers' crotch isn't covered in bees.
S27E12_616#Really?
S27E12_618#Let's put this good Bart to the test.
S27E12_621#Thank god, the Department of Homeland Security
S27E12_623#financed this cherry picker to detangle the flag.
S27E12_626#Extend, extend.
S27E12_629#All this extending is making me thirsty.
S27E12_636#Just smash the window,
S27E12_637#Unlatch the brake,
S27E12_640#And skinner plummets to his hilarious doom.
S27E12_645#Now he's safer than ever.
S27E12_648#Yup, you're officially Springfield's bad boy now.
S27E12_653#And I am up to the task.
S27E12_659#Dad, we're taking Apu out to cheer him up.
S27E12_661#This time, please watch the kids.
S27E12_663#How about you pay me like a real sitter?
S27E12_667#Another one of your nonsensical, rambling stories.
S27E12_670#I'd like to get paid.
S27E12_672#In corn cob pipes, right?
S27E12_675#Because in 1967, you and...
S27E12_678#Just get going.
S27E12_680#Dad, check out this "A" I got in citizenship.
S27E12_681#Sorry, boy, late for dinner.
S27E12_685#I know exactly how you feel, Bart.
S27E12_687#This family isn't the greatest at recognizing achievement.
S27E12_690#Wow, now I understand why you're so mad all the time.
S27E12_692#I really do.
S27E12_694#Aw, thank you, Bart.
S27E12_696#Hey, you want to go move our mouths without speaking
S27E12_698#to drive grampa nuts?
S27E12_699#I'd like that.
S27E12_703#What the...? Speak up.
S27E12_705#Oh, I guess I'll just have to turn my hearing aid
S27E12_707#up to the max.
S27E12_717#Another... Hey! Another chianti, please.
S27E12_719#Uh, maybe you should slow down a little.
S27E12_722#Oh, yes, because it will take all of my faculties
S27E12_724#Tomorrow to affix my name tag right side up.
S27E12_729#Ooh, there he is.
S27E12_731#The so-called marketing genius
S27E12_734#who increased revenue over 500%.
S27E12_736#Please, don't make a scene.
S27E12_738#But if you do, bring back bread.
S27E12_741#Oh, hey, uncle.
S27E12_743#Aren't you going to introduce me to your friends?
S27E12_745#What, are you embarrassed by me?
S27E12_747#Um, well, yes, a little.
S27E12_748#You are ashamed of me?
S27E12_750#Me, who has been as loyal to you
S27E12_753#As gunga din to sergeant archibald cutter?
S27E12_755#That's exactly what I'm talking about.
S27E12_757#You're my uncle, bruh, and I love you,
S27E12_759#But you're a stereotype, man.
S27E12_761#: Take a penny, leave a penny.
S27E12_763#I'm Indian. I do yoga.
S27E12_765#Why don't you go back to the temple of doom, Dr. Jones?
S27E12_768#Temple of doom... Three months I worked on that
S27E12_770#And all you can see is my hand in one shot.
S27E12_773#Big whoop. Thank you very much, Mr. Spielberg.
S27E12_775#And-and I say that you are a stereotype.
S27E12_778#All you do is spout stupid, hipster buzzwords.
S27E12_781#Swipe left on that accusation.
S27E12_783#Epic swipe left.
S27E12_785#Well, my dear nephew, this stereotype will no longer
S27E12_789#Be a troublesome potato in your chicken vindaloo.
S27E12_791#Good luck to you.
S27E12_793#Stereotype-a?
S27E12_794#Who's a stereotype-a?
S27E12_796#That's a spicy accusation.
S27E12_798#You pipe-a down. ?
S27E12_802#Hello? Hello, anyone here?
S27E12_804#Hey, brah, come in and chillax.
S27E12_808#Uh, I came in for the new issue of Toes and Torsos,
S27E12_810#But, uh, that can wait.
S27E12_812#What's going on here, my friend?
S27E12_814#Oh, I lost my store and my identity,
S27E12_817#And all I have left is my vest here.
S27E12_820#330 million gods and not one of them listens to me.
S27E12_822#What are you doing?
S27E12_823#I leave for one second,
S27E12_825#And you're talking like a Mumbai riverboat pilot.
S27E12_827#Bombay! To me it will always be Bombay!
S27E12_829#Not cool, man.
S27E12_830#Give me your vest.
S27E12_831#No, please, you can't take it.
S27E12_833#This vest has a bullet hole for every time I have been shot.
S27E12_836#It is my lucky vest.
S27E12_838#I love you, man, but you're fired. "Fo-evah."
S27E12_843#Amateur.
S27E12_845#Whoa, whoa, whoa, Apu, you need a visit to moe's tavern,
S27E12_847#Your downward spiral headquarters.
S27E12_850#Hey, we're on the cover of this month's giving up magazine.
S27E12_852#Check it out,
S27E12_854#That was the last issue ever.
S27E12_855#Hey, guys, this is too sad.
S27E12_857#We-we gotta help Apu get his store back.
S27E12_859#Yeah, okay, let's see, uh,
S27E12_861#Homer, your boy's no good, right? ?Not much.
S27E12_863#Well, why don't you ask him to pull a prank to help apu
S27E12_866#Turn his nice, new store here back into a rat hole?
S27E12_869#Well, I kinda straightened him out.
S27E12_871#I was hoping he'd stay that way till the marines take him.
S27E12_874#You can't think of yourself, homer.
S27E12_876#Apu's always been there for us.
S27E12_878#Yeah, except for that hurricane when he jacked up the prices.
S27E12_881#Okay, so I got a little gouge-y,
S27E12_883#But I-I don't hold the looting against you guys.
S27E12_885#some looting.
S27E12_887#I got there late, and all that was left was a bag of ice,
S27E12_890#And they played the clip on CNN for a week.
S27E12_892#But I am one of you now.
S27E12_894#I sponsor your little league teams,
S27E12_896#And I sell you christmas gifts
S27E12_898#on 9:00 a.m. On christmas morning.
S27E12_899#Yeah, that Hello Kitty cell phone cover
S27E12_901#Really saved my ass with Marge,
S27E12_903#And when I think of it, what do we have children for
S27E12_906#If not to sacrifice them for our needs?
S27E12_908#Hear, hear.
S27E12_909#Hear, hear.
S27E12_912#Oh, gee, I guess you guys
S27E12_914#Are gonna have to buy more beers.
S27E12_920#Ba-bart?
S27E12_921#Bart?
S27E12_922#Ba-bart...
S27E12_924#Oh, leave me alone.
S27E12_927#Listen, boy, I need you to do a prank for Apu.
S27E12_929#I don't get it, man.
S27E12_931#You told me to stop pranking, and I did.
S27E12_932#And you know what?
S27E12_933#I don't miss it.
S27E12_935#Without you strangling me, my throat is finally healing.
S27E12_938#I can sing again.
S27E12_942#*Praise god from whom all blessings flow*
S27E12_944#*Praise him*
S27E12_946#*All creatures here below*
S27E12_949#You know what, you're right.
S27E12_950#What was I thinking?
S27E12_951#Go back to sleep.
S27E12_954#- Dad. - ?Yes?
S27E12_956#Say someone were to do this prank,
S27E12_959#would the prankster receive a later bedtime?
S27E12_962#Say 9:30?
S27E12_965#No, no, you know something, boy, I realized I made a big mistake.
S27E12_967#I like the new, well-behaved you.
S27E12_969#I can stop saving up for that house near the prison.
S27E12_981#Oh, I never should have bought
S27E12_983#that clockwork orange video for his fifth birthday.
S27E12_986#I thought it would help him tell time,
S27E12_988#and now I've awoken a monster.
S27E12_990#You awoke me, too.
S27E12_992#I thought you were sleeping over at Rachel's.
S27E12_994#Rachel was my imaginary friend when I was three.
S27E12_997#Then when she was five, she moved to White Plains, New York.
S27E12_1000#What? I never said good-bye.
S27E12_1001#Well, they wanted to leave quickly.
S27E12_1002#Her dad had been caught in an affair.
S27E12_1004#Her brother took a semester off college,
S27E12_1006#and he never went back.
S27E12_1007#And her mother?
S27E12_1009#Her mother's the really sad story.
S27E12_1011#Oh, I've-I've heard enough.
S27E12_1017#My return to prankdom is elegant in its simplicity.
S27E12_1021#All we do is cut the power in the store for 30 seconds.
S27E12_1023#And no preservatives in the food,
S27E12_1025#so everything will immediately go bad.
S27E12_1028#Oh, it's an honor to be the guy you explain it to.
S27E12_1031#Bart, wait!
S27E12_1033#I like the new you.
S27E12_1036#Listen, before you flip those circuit breakers,
S27E12_1039#Look deep in your sister's eyes and tell me what you see.
S27E12_1043#I see... love.
S27E12_1046#Unconditional love.
S27E12_1049#Which means I can do whatever I want.
S27E12_1062#Ah! Save us, chemicals!
S27E12_1065#At least the mushrooms are okay.
S27E12_1067#That is a wheel of brie!
S27E12_1073#Come on, this is the cleanest place in town,
S27E12_1074#and you know it.
S27E12_1078#Another failed millennial.
S27E12_1080#Who is a clich¨¦ now?
S27E12_1082#Now to remove all signs of our presence.
S27E12_1094#We must have used it up during the parade.
S27E12_1096#Mm, it was a great parade.
S27E12_1099#Aw, let's get out of here!
S27E12_1102#*You're simply the best*
S27E12_1110#I am sorry, nephew.
S27E12_1112#I was jealous, and karma has exacted a terrible price.
S27E12_1115#Word. And I was kind of a douche wheel.
S27E12_1118#You know, even your way of apologizing offends me.
S27E12_1120#What is this?
S27E12_1124#My ruin and my redemption.
S27E12_1126#My last two dollars.
S27E12_1128#I have nothing to scratch it with.
S27E12_1132#Use me, Apu.
S27E12_1134#Make my life worth something.
S27E12_1138#No, uncle a, it's a clown move, bruh.
S27E12_1141#Or maybe, just maybe, a genius clown move.
S27E12_1144#Sheldon,
S27E12_1146#Sheldon...
S27E12_1151#Three sheldons!
S27E12_1153#It is a winner, and it is so much money,
S27E12_1156#which means so many more tickets.
S27E12_1159#Precious, precious tickets.
S27E12_1161#I... No, no, it's money.
S27E12_1167#Oh, it is so good to see you.
S27E12_1169#I have my store back, my friend.
S27E12_1171#But I have something that I wanted even more, you know,
S27E12_1173#a feeling that I belong.
S27E12_1176#I'm glad I could help by giving my son a little nudge
S27E12_1178#in the wrong direction.
S27E12_1181#And now, I have something very, very special for you, my friend.
S27E12_1185#This is the legendary, jumbo, golden squishee cup.
S27E12_1188#It will be refilled by me,
S27E12_1190#for free, for the rest of your life.
S27E12_1192#Holy moly, all those squishees?
S27E12_1194#How much is that gonna cost you?
S27E12_1196#Ah, about three bucks.
S27E12_1201#this time it's 'cause I let Ralph drive.
S27E12_1203#I thought it was pretend.
S27E12_1207#Let it never be said I cannot admit a mistake,
S27E12_1210#especially in the middle of a recall campaign.
S27E12_1214#We will now destroy the new Jebediah springfield statue.
S27E12_1217#Chief, you may fire when ready.
S27E12_1222#Damn it!
S27E13_180#Cletus, you know I can fry up whatever you can shoot down.
S27E13_184#Oh, Brandine, of all the cousins I coulda married,
S27E13_186#you was my sister.
S27E13_191#Carl, this is Mandy.
S27E13_193#Mandy, isn't Carl everything I said he was?
S27E13_195#Okay, Lenny, time to stop talking about Carl.
S27E13_198#Why don't you to ask me to stop breathing?
S27E13_200#Oh, Marge, it's so great
S27E13_203#to combine the two loves of my life: Goofing off and you.
S27E13_206#Hey, listen, there's one fantasy
S27E13_208#I've always wanted to indulge in.
S27E13_210#If you're willing.
S27E13_219#What are those frisky hounds up to now?
S27E13_225#Wait a minute.
S27E13_227#That contractor said this was a bottomless pit!
S27E13_229#I'll have his license!
S27E13_231#Hey, professor!
S27E13_233#I didn't know you worked here at the plant.
S27E13_234#I consult.
S27E13_236#Sometimes they listen, sometimes not.
S27E13_238#People have died. You didn't hear that from me.
S27E13_240#So, who are you here with?
S27E13_242#Well, no one as yet.
S27E13_244#But I haven't turned on the old Frink charm.
S27E13_247#Hello there, Vo-Ivy.
S27E13_253#Well, there's, uh, no mistaking that message.
S27E13_259#Hello, Homer!
S27E13_260#D'oh!
S27E13_261#What is it, dad?
S27E13_263#It's Valentine's Day.
S27E13_264#I'm alone.
S27E13_265#And that cat who can smell
S27E13_267#if you're dying is staring at me.
S27E13_269#What are you looking at?!
S27E13_271#Son, I'm scared.
S27E13_273#This cat has taken five this year.
S27E13_277#People in their 90s don't just suddenly die for no reason.
S27E13_279#Please come.
S27E13_282#Okay, dad. We'll come over.
S27E13_284#Can you pick me up a pack of diapers?
S27E13_286#Oh, for-- they always think they're for me.
S27E13_289#Fine. I'll just take a large drum of butt ointment.
S27E13_292#Hurry!
S27E13_304#Happy Valentine's Day, everybody.
S27E13_308#I don't see why, unless you found that missing puzzle piece.
S27E13_311#How 'bout I put on some music?
S27E13_314#*I... Never...*
S27E13_318#*Smiled again...*
S27E13_323#Oh, I used to dance with my Auggie to that tune.
S27E13_327#Yeah, me and my Bubbeleh made love to that song.
S27E13_330#Creating a kid who never visits.
S27E13_333#And now back to prairie home companion.
S27E13_337#Pull the plug!
S27E13_339#No, on me.
S27E13_343#Okay, time for some Valentine's candy for our swinging seniors.
S27E13_347#Don't patronize us, we know it's pills.
S27E13_351#But it's a new brand and they're so pretty-- look, green.
S27E13_354#Like M&M's with hope.
S27E13_356#Oh, it's starting to kick in.
S27E13_358#Much... Better.
S27E13_364#Suddenly, I don't want to kvetch.
S27E13_365#I want to kvell!
S27E13_367#I can feel all the tension going out of my beard.
S27E13_388#Mona? I thought you were gone.
S27E13_390#Nonsense, Abe.
S27E13_392#I didn't leave you and I am never going to leave you.
S27E13_394#That doesn't sound like the Mona I knew.
S27E13_397#I'm the Mona that lives in your memory,
S27E13_399#with all the anger turned to honey by nostalgia.
S27E13_402#So what you're saying is,
S27E13_404#this is really happening.
S27E13_416#Do you think it's okay to leave them here?
S27E13_418#Marge, all we ever do is leave them here.
S27E13_421#I just think there's more we should do.
S27E13_423#We could visit your mother.
S27E13_425#No. No, you're right. Let's go home.
S27E13_427#Check it out, guys.
S27E13_429#CVS stands for cheap Valentines' surplus.
S27E13_432#You get a box! You get a box!
S27E13_434#Haven't forgotten about you, suspicious Iranian coworker.
S27E13_437#Please, call me Dennis.
S27E13_441#Oh, my gurvy is muh.
S27E13_444#Professor?
S27E13_446#Professor, come on, this is a workplace.
S27E13_448#Ooh, dregs!
S27E13_451#Oh, my egg head is pickled, muh-oyvic.
S27E13_454#Did you sleep here all night?
S27E13_456#Yes, you are right, I did.
S27E13_458#Valentine's day, you see, is quite difficult for me.
S27E13_460#I saw that Stephen Hawking movie and all I could think is,
S27E13_463#"He's got a girl?" Give me a frickin' break.
S27E13_465#Two girls.
S27E13_467#Oh, I'll never win,
S27E13_469#and I'll always have to only be looking.
S27E13_472#Listen, pal, I've had plenty of experience with one woman.
S27E13_474#And I can tell you,
S27E13_476#Relationships are just trial and error.
S27E13_478#Like anniversaries.
S27E13_480#First I tried "Don't remember,"
S27E13_481#then "Remember too late,"
S27E13_484#then I happily settled on "Make Lisa remember."
S27E13_487#And my relationship with Lisa has never been better.
S27E13_490#Yes, you say trial and error, eh?
S27E13_493#My good man, that is nothing more than the scientific method.
S27E13_496#Well, now, that's a little wasteful.
S27E13_498#Ah, much better.
S27E13_501#I shall use science to uncover the secret to women.
S27E13_504#Homer, scientific research
S27E13_507#can solve anything except for cold fusion, quasars,
S27E13_510#the interior of black holes and what preceded the big bang.
S27E13_514#But everything else can be solved, including love.
S27E13_516#Pish-posh, professor.
S27E13_519#What makes a guy and a girl click isn't science.
S27E13_521#It's chemistry!
S27E13_523#- Which is science. - What?!
S27E13_527#See, I have asked an enormous cross-section of women
S27E13_530#one single question--
S27E13_532#What attracts you to a man?
S27E13_534#Let us listen and learn and have some lemonade,
S27E13_536#which I just squeezed nicely.
S27E13_538#The most important thing that I look for...
S27E13_541#I like it when they're tall.
S27E13_543#- Blue eyes! - Definitely wants kids.
S27E13_545#Hmm, I didn't hear the last one.
S27E13_550#First I'll replace these coke bottle glasses
S27E13_552#with invisible blue contacts.
S27E13_556#Next, of course, is shoe lifts for height.
S27E13_558#Make you much taller, look down upon people.
S27E13_560#It's wonderful. Whoa, whoa...
S27E13_562#Hey, look at me. I'm Herman Munster!
S27E13_565#Actually, he had Lily, who was quite a dish.
S27E13_569#So, do you, uh, find me attractive?
S27E13_572#Sorry, but no.
S27E13_573#Oh, curse the luck!
S27E13_574#And this is an android
S27E13_576#that I programmed to say nothing but "Yes."
S27E13_580#Why? Why? Why?
S27E13_582#What am I over-look-ing?
S27E13_585#Uh, professor... Don't be offended.
S27E13_587#Do you think it might be your voice?
S27E13_589#Why, what's wrong with my voice,
S27E13_591#with the up and down and the extra words
S27E13_594#and the terminal nonsense in the hoyven clyven wayen.
S27E13_598#Oh, my god, it's the voice.
S27E13_601#Hello.
S27E13_603#We're here to see Abe Simpson.
S27E13_604#I brought him a homemade card!
S27E13_606#I brought me. That's enough.
S27E13_609#Oh... What the...?
S27E13_612#Gee, I thought they'd be over this by now.
S27E13_617#Wow, they are really out of it.
S27E13_620#There must be some way to take advantage of them.
S27E13_621#You're telling me!
S27E13_627#This little device, which fits under the tongue,
S27E13_629#will change everything.
S27E13_633#This voice is an amalgam of great voices
S27E13_635#from Clark Gable...
S27E13_636#To Walter Cronkite...
S27E13_638#To Rush Limbaugh!
S27E13_639#I don't agree with his politics,
S27E13_641#But his body is a natural echo chamber.
S27E13_644#Wow. That does change everything.
S27E13_646#You turned me on.
S27E13_648#Oh, it's time for a little field test, I see.
S27E13_651#Any other advice, Homer?
S27E13_653#Yep-- hang out at yoga classes.
S27E13_655#That's where the ladies are.
S27E13_657#How would you know about yoga class?
S27E13_659#Uh, I thought it was yogurt class.
S27E13_665#Twenty-one! Dealer wins again.
S27E13_669#Now, here's our headliner, Dolly Parton.
S27E13_676#Oh, she's good.
S27E13_678#Bart!
S27E13_679#Ay, caramba!
S27E13_681#You're taking advantage of these people
S27E13_683#who don't know where they are.
S27E13_685#I'm taking them back where they belong.
S27E13_686#Oh, no, you don't.
S27E13_688#He just comped me a suite!
S27E13_690#Fantastic!
S27E13_701#You can't keep pumping powerful drugs
S27E13_703#into people who can't even bite into a peach.
S27E13_706#Mrs. Simpson, it's a fact.
S27E13_707#If these seniors aren't medicated,
S27E13_709#I can't binge-watch Boardwalk Empire.
S27E13_712#Nucky dies at the end!
S27E13_713#Yeah, well, screw you.
S27E13_715#I'm going to report you to the state.
S27E13_716#I really don't care.
S27E13_719#Wha...?
S27E13_720#You broke me.
S27E13_722#I'm going to say something I've never said.
S27E13_724#How can I help you?
S27E13_727#Um, I'll wait outside
S27E13_729#'cause they might make me do something.
S27E13_731#I've changed my height, I've changed my eyes,
S27E13_732#My relationship status--
S27E13_734#I-I don't know why I put "Unavailable" there.
S27E13_736#That certainly did not help matters.
S27E13_739#But now it is time to change my voice...
S27E13_743#Oyce... Voy...
S27E13_745#And the hoyvin and the flayvin
S27E13_747#Are now "Hasta la vista, frinky."
S27E13_755#I'm always next to the jerk
S27E13_757#who comes here to meet women.
S27E13_758#Hey, look, I get you.
S27E13_760#You broke up with a long- time high school boyfriend
S27E13_762#'cause he just wasn't going anywhere.
S27E13_764#Then you play the field, but it's all losers
S27E13_766#who just want to take from you.
S27E13_767#Now you're just hoping beyond hope
S27E13_769#For a man you can hug
S27E13_771#Who'll organize the wires behind your TV.
S27E13_773#And believe you me, sweetheart,
S27E13_775#I can organize every wire you have.
S27E13_777#Now I'd like to show you a picture of my new puppy.
S27E13_779#Yeah, his name's...
S27E13_781#Logarithm.
S27E13_783#I mean Larry.
S27E13_785#Aw... Here's my number.
S27E13_787#And to prove it's not a lie...
S27E13_791#Yeah, baby.
S27E13_794#Call me!
S27E13_798#Man, you're reading page three
S27E13_799#and the next thing you know,
S27E13_801#You're finishing the last article, hmm.
S27E13_802#I got all their numbers!
S27E13_804#Boy, you are smooth.
S27E13_805#Carl smooth.
S27E13_806#Now I'd better get home.
S27E13_808#And in case Marge is mad, can I borrow that chip?
S27E13_811#Oh, sure thing, pal. I have extras.
S27E13_818#Chitter, chitter, baby.
S27E13_826#I was so worried.
S27E13_827#Where have you been?
S27E13_828#No, don't tell me.
S27E13_830#I don't want to hear one of your stupid lies.
S27E13_832#Marge, my dear,
S27E13_834#You are the pork chop with gravy on top.
S27E13_838#And I'm the applesauce that brings out your flavor.
S27E13_841#Oh, Homie.
S27E13_847#What the hell was that?
S27E13_848#What the...?
S27E13_849#You're not my wife.
S27E13_851#Which I find intriguing.
S27E13_853#Suit yourself.
S27E13_858#So, professor, tell me all about last night.
S27E13_859#Dish-dish-dish!
S27E13_861#Uh, yes, well, I can't talk now. I'm on a date.
S27E13_864#And then I have a date.
S27E13_866#And then another date.
S27E13_868#Is there such a thing as too much of a good thing?
S27E13_870#This is my cousin, nookie kwan.
S27E13_872#I'm number one on the east side.
S27E13_874#Oh, gah-layvin.
S27E13_877#Have any oyou seen John Frink?
S27E13_878#He ain't here.
S27E13_879#But his hover-tronic
S27E13_881#Frink-a-ma-car is parked outside.
S27E13_883#Hey, if I say he ain't here, he ain't here.
S27E13_886#Hey, Moe, there's a rat floating in my beer.
S27E13_888#It ain't there.
S27E13_891#Thank you, my good man,
S27E13_893#But, uh, I saw some terrible things down there.
S27E13_896#Like for one, Moe is pantsless.
S27E13_899#Hey, it's apron-only Tuesday.
S27E13_902#You're a lucky guy, Frinky.
S27E13_903#Got all the chicks you want
S27E13_905#While I can't find a single woman
S27E13_907#To put up with me and my domesticated wolverine.
S27E13_909#Lucky Frink. I got nothin'.
S27E13_911#Some guys get all the breaks.
S27E13_912#Let me see here.
S27E13_914#Uh, needy men...
S27E13_915#Plus lonely women...
S27E13_917#I-I just bring them together!
S27E13_919#Hey, that's some nice thinkin' there.
S27E13_921#Now, how 'bout a beer and a baked potato.
S27E13_922#Ah, that sounds nice.
S27E13_924#We don't serve baked potatoes.
S27E13_927#What happened?
S27E13_929#Everyone is incredibly depressed.
S27E13_939#I admit the hallucinations were getting out of hand,
S27E13_940#so I stopped the meds.
S27E13_943#And hid them in the one place they'll never look: The library.
S27E13_946#Well, there's one thing you didn't count on--
S27E13_949#I go there because it's the only room in this building with heat.
S27E13_954#Grampa, you're not allowed to take dangerous drugs
S27E13_957#Unless they're in a little paper cup.
S27E13_958#Listen here.
S27E13_960#Every night I watch my roommate cry himself to sleep.
S27E13_963#Yesterday I found out it was a mirror!
S27E13_965#I'm gonna find my Mona!
S27E13_969#There's a lesson here-- never visit grampa.
S27E13_977#My old car.
S27E13_979#Oh, that's some fine hallucinatin'.
S27E13_983#To the good ol' days before polio was cured!
S27E13_1001#Hot diggity!
S27E13_1003#It's America the way I liked it,
S27E13_1006#before we went to the moon and discovered how boring it was.
S27E13_1011#I found the one happy moment in 80 years of life
S27E13_1014#and I ain't leavin' it.
S27E13_1016#Oh, this ain't right.
S27E13_1018#That's better!
S27E13_1020#This ends right now!
S27E13_1022#She's not real. None of this is real.
S27E13_1025#Imaginary cigarettes? Nonexistent candy?
S27E13_1029#Get outta here, Marge!
S27E13_1031#Unescorted women like you aren't allowed in this era!
S27E13_1034#I'm not getting out, I'm cutting in.
S27E13_1035#You can't live here.
S27E13_1037#You have people in the real world who love you.
S27E13_1040#Two are standing right over here.
S27E13_1043#If you live in the past, you'll never have us.
S27E13_1045#And what's more precious to a grampa than his grandchildren?
S27E13_1049#Particularly his grandson.
S27E13_1052#Aw, your sexist argument has won me over.
S27E13_1055#We women will have our day.
S27E13_1057#Attaboy.
S27E13_1059#Good-bye, Mona.
S27E13_1061#And good-bye, pack of cigarettes for a quarter.
S27E13_1064#I think I'll miss you the most.
S27E13_1069#So what, uh...
S27E13_1071#All that dancin' around with me meant nothin'?
S27E13_1075#Oh, I'll be back to steal a kiss later.
S27E13_1076#And as for you...
S27E13_1078#I've got more involved plans.
S27E13_1084#So, Frink is finally going to announce which woman
S27E13_1087#he's chosen to be with at the springfield planetarium.
S27E13_1090#It's like an episode of the bachelor,
S27E13_1092#But you drive there and pay six dollars for parking.
S27E13_1095#Why are we both explaining it if we all know what's happening?
S27E13_1097#I like talking to you.
S27E13_1107#Ladies, please pay attention here.
S27E13_1111#You see, I, uh... I thought I was the only one who was lonely.
S27E13_1114#But I have learned that loneliness is everywhere,
S27E13_1117#like superhero movies.
S27E13_1120#How many times can batman begin?
S27E13_1123#I have reworked my algorithms
S27E13_1125#to make you not like me,
S27E13_1127#but to find the man that will make each of you happiest, yes.
S27E13_1130#Uh, release the bachelors!
S27E13_1132#I hope they enjoy it.
S27E13_1140#Duffman would love to be taught
S27E13_1142#how to speak in the first-person.
S27E13_1146#Everyone's paired up.
S27E13_1148#Almost everyone's paired up.
S27E13_1150#Professor, what about you?
S27E13_1152#Where's your match?
S27E13_1154#For me, my true love is intellectual conquest,
S27E13_1157#the-the music of the spheres.
S27E13_1161#Well, sometimes it's good just to be alone.
S27E13_1168#*And now the purple dusk of twilight time*
S27E13_1173#*Steals across the meadows of my heart*
S27E13_1179#*High up in the sky*
S27E13_1182#*The little stars climb*
S27E13_1185#What are you doing with my daughter?!
S27E13_1189#Why did I build a mother? Oi, goy-vick.
S27E13_1194#Wait a minute, how come we're all back here?
S27E13_1196#I flushed the rest of the pills down the toilet.
S27E13_1199#Looks like they made their way to the reservoir.
S27E13_1201#We should really try to wake up.
S27E13_1203#Are you kidding? There's a full buffet
S27E13_1205#and Dean Martin's here.
S27E13_1206#Eh, that's right, Pally.
S27E13_1207#Here, try the shrimp.
S27E13_1209#Some have gone bad, but, uh, most are fine.
S27E14_69#you ain't handy.
S27E14_71#Unless we need a big fat paperweight.
S27E14_73#I'll paperweight you!
S27E14_76#Homie, sweetie,
S27E14_77#replacing a tile is something
S27E14_79#you really need a professional for.
S27E14_82#I know how to replace a tile.
S27E14_83#All guys do.
S27E14_85#We talk about it all the time.
S27E14_86#Grout?
S27E14_89#There's no stopping what I've started here.
S27E14_91#Here's your tile. Have fun.
S27E14_94#Handy... man.
S27E14_97#Lisa, honey, do you have any idea how to replace a floor...?
S27E14_99#Here's a video tutorial on replacing a tile.
S27E14_101#I don't know if I need a whole tutorial to teach me...
S27E14_103#- You're tapping. You have to swipe. - I'm-I'm swiping, I'm swiping.
S27E14_106#Pretend you're swiping chocolate icing off a cake.
S27E14_108#- All right, how's that? - Ah, see? There.
S27E14_109#- There it is, yeah. Perfect. - There really is icing on here.
S27E14_111#All right, then.
S27E14_114#Hi there. If you're watching this video,
S27E14_116#you've got a job that needs doing
S27E14_118#but you're too cheap to pay for it.
S27E14_120#Man, this guy's inside my head.
S27E14_122#Now, replacing a tile is a simple task.
S27E14_125#As long as the substrate beneath the tile isn't rotted.
S27E14_132#If there is rot in your substrate,
S27E14_134#we will now play loud music so you can curse.
S27E14_139#Stupid floor! Why...
S27E14_142#Why was I born a homeowner?
S27E14_144#- On your marks. - On your marks.
S27E14_145#- Get set. - Get set.
S27E14_146#- Twins! - Twins!
S27E14_148#Loser!
S27E14_150#Oh, boy.
S27E14_154#Oh. Why is everyone passing us?
S27E14_159#You know how scared I am of going on a slant.
S27E14_164#Latchkey kids rule!
S27E14_170#I can't die now.
S27E14_172#I actually did my homework.
S27E14_181#I'm sorry, ma'am.
S27E14_183#Come spring, I'll go get that for you.
S27E14_184#Dang good-for-nothin' cart.
S27E14_186#Always fighting to go left when I wanted to go right.
S27E14_189#It was my only friend.
S27E14_198#Now take your sponge, wipe away the excess grout
S27E14_200#and you're done.
S27E14_203#Oh, my God,
S27E14_205#it looks like what it's supposed to look like.
S27E14_208#I did man work!
S27E14_210#My hero.
S27E14_212#I'm happy to say I was wrong.
S27E14_214#I'll put Maggie down and make you a snack.
S27E14_217#Something bacon-y.
S27E14_220#A bacon apology sandwich.
S27E14_225#What? No.
S27E14_226#No. No.
S27E14_231#Oh, I sealed in the cat.
S27E14_233#If it dies, it'll stink up the whole house.
S27E14_235#Also, the kids like it.
S27E14_238#Stupid genius cat.
S27E14_240#She went from under the floor to inside the wall.
S27E14_244#Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
S27E14_245#More repairs?
S27E14_247#Aah! Marge, I should tell you something.
S27E14_250#I knew it. You're not a handy...
S27E14_252#No. You did not know it.
S27E14_254#I was going to say I'm not stopping with the tile.
S27E14_257#Oh, no. Once you've been bitten
S27E14_259#by the repair bug, you can't quit.
S27E14_262#How would you like hot water in the bathtub again?
S27E14_266#I'll go get the "H" knob out of my jewelry box.
S27E14_269#Mmm. Don't take long, handy man.
S27E14_272#Handyman.
S27E14_276#Okay, cat, I'll get you out tomorrow, but here's dinner.
S27E14_280#Lasagna, which I know cats like.
S27E14_285#Nothing to see here. Just kneeling
S27E14_286#in front of the electric outlet,
S27E14_288#appreciating Edison's miracle.
S27E14_291#Look, Hettie, you got two choices.
S27E14_292#Under the bed or in the closet.
S27E14_294#I suppose I will take
S27E14_296#the closet.
S27E14_298#Oh, my goodness. This is like my heyday
S27E14_300#when I was livin' in that car.
S27E14_302#You know, you get enough parking tickets on the front,
S27E14_304#they act like curtains.
S27E14_310#Hey, mornin', boss.
S27E14_312#Hey, what you take in your coffee?
S27E14_314#'Cause I got sugar and I got something called
S27E14_316#"not for individual sale."
S27E14_318#Listen. I don't think you should get too comfortable here.
S27E14_321#Okay, okay. Thought you might say that,
S27E14_324#but, uh, what if I make it amenable to you?
S27E14_327#If you hide me here, I'll give you a dollar a day.
S27E14_329#Here's one week in advance.
S27E14_331#Yes, I'm a slumlord.
S27E14_334#*Started from the bottom, now we're here*
S27E14_337#*Started from the bottom, now the whole team here*
S27E14_340#*Started from the bottom, now we're here*
S27E14_343#*Started from the bottom, now the whole team here*
S27E14_345#*Started from the bottom, now we're here*
S27E14_348#*Started from the bottom, now my whole team here*
S27E14_351#*Started from the bottom, now we're here*
S27E14_354#*Started from the bottom, now my whole team here*
S27E14_357#*Started from the bottom, now we're here* 
S27E14_359#*Started from the bottom, now we're here*
S27E14_362#*I done kept it real from the jump* 
S27E14_365#*Living at my mama house, we'd argue every mornin'*
S27E14_367#*I was-- I was trying to get it on my own*
S27E14_370#*Working all night, traffic on the way home* 
S27E14_373#*And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?*
S27E14_376#*I gave you the keys, told you bring it right back"*
S27E14_379#*I just-- I just think it's funny how it goes*
S27E14_382#*Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show*
S27E14_383#*And we started from the...*
S27E14_389#Sorry, cat. Had to go to work.
S27E14_391#Then there was a freeway chase on the news.
S27E14_393#Had to watch it till the end.
S27E14_395#The guy got arrested in a cul-de-sac.
S27E14_397#They never do what I yell at them to do.
S27E14_403#Oh, you're in the ceiling?
S27E14_408#Do not use top step?
S27E14_410#Stupid government, trying to keep us down.
S27E14_416#Where is Bart getting this money?
S27E14_421#Lisa?
S27E14_422#Just what do you think you're up to?
S27E14_426#Come on. You can tell Dr. Tuna.
S27E14_427#Okay, I admit it.
S27E14_429#I think Bart's up to something funny,
S27E14_431#so I'm snooping in his room.
S27E14_433#No snooping. You know what they say about curiosity.
S27E14_435#- It killed the cat? - The cat's fine!
S27E14_437#Stop asking about the cat!
S27E14_441#Lose a Kewpie doll in front of your gal.
S27E14_446#Hey, boss.
S27E14_448#We have a situation here.
S27E14_450#You owe me three weeks' back rent.
S27E14_454#Bart Simpson, you are cruelly exploiting
S27E14_456#a poor, unfortunate woman.
S27E14_458#So, you're gonna tell Mom
S27E14_459#and she's gonna kick Hettie out.
S27E14_461#Girlie, ain't you got a heart?
S27E14_463#Nope. All brain, no heart.
S27E14_466#Yeah. She looks like a little bitty railroad bull.
S27E14_469#Now I got to sing for my supper.
S27E14_471#I wrote this one a few days ago.
S27E14_473#This is a song about loss.
S27E14_477#*It was a cart*
S27E14_481#*Meant for shopping*
S27E14_485#*It came to mean*
S27E14_489#*Much more to me*
S27E14_492#*It held the pan*
S27E14_496#*I cook my slop in*
S27E14_501#*And my old PlayStation 3*
S27E14_508#*It was my home*
S27E14_511#*And my place of worship*
S27E14_515#*It was my home* 
S27E14_519#*And it was kinda my car*
S27E14_524#*Now you're just rolling underwater*
S27E14_531#*While Safeway wonders*
S27E14_534#*Where you are*
S27E14_540#Whoa! My roommate is talented!
S27E14_544#If I know my Smithsonian Folkways,
S27E14_546#that was an Appalachian folk song.
S27E14_548#Well, I'm from Lickskillet, Kentucky,
S27E14_551#just shy of the Appalachia Trail.
S27E14_553#Really? Oh, I love, love, love indigenous mountain music.
S27E14_557#Well, isn't that fascinatin'?
S27E14_559#I'm glad you liked the song.
S27E14_562#Yes. I liked it very, very, very m...
S27E14_565#Oh! You want money.
S27E14_567#I'm sorry. I don't have any.
S27E14_570#I'm also a musician.
S27E14_572#But you can stay in our house.
S27E14_574#Ha-ha! It's a deal! Back in the boy's closet.
S27E14_576#No, Hettie. You're a human being.
S27E14_578#You can sleep in my closet.
S27E14_580#Hmm. Well, la-di-da.
S27E14_582#How much you charge?
S27E14_584#Nothing. Maybe we can talk a little music.
S27E14_587#Ugh. Boy, what's your price again?
S27E14_589#Okay, we'll only talk about it if you want to!
S27E14_591#But it would be an honor.
S27E14_592#Okay, let's go.
S27E14_593#Oh, you've hurt yourself.
S27E14_595#Uh, nope, that's syrup.
S27E14_597#Oh, let me find you a Wet-Nap.
S27E14_599#I just woke up from a wet nap.
S27E14_600#Okay. Conversation's over.
S27E14_601#Check, one, two.
S27E14_604#All right. No, no, no, leave the windows open.
S27E14_606#I like crickets and night breeze in my music.
S27E14_608#They do well together.
S27E14_609#Have you always been musical?
S27E14_611#You know, first sound I ever heard was my daddy fiddlin'.
S27E14_614#His name was Bascom Lee Boggs.
S27E14_617#Bascom Lee Boggs?!
S27E14_619#He played with some seminal Appalachian bands,
S27E14_621#like Snug and the Cousin Huggers,
S27E14_623#Lead Paint Larry and the Drooly Boys,
S27E14_625#Howlin' Sue and Her Vestigial Organ,
S27E14_627#and Bloody Mary and the Coalmine Canaries.
S27E14_630#Did your daddy teach you to fiddle?
S27E14_631#No.
S27E14_633#He was gonna start me out on the cigar box banjo,
S27E14_635#but, uh, before he could, he-he lost his sight.
S27E14_638#Oh, no. I'm sorry.
S27E14_640#Yeah, he got shot in the face.
S27E14_642#You know them puzzles where you slide the tiles?
S27E14_644#He looks a little like that now.
S27E14_646#My mother was an amazing banjo player.
S27E14_650#- Unfortunately, she did also go blind. - Really?
S27E14_652#Yeah, it was winter and she was runnin' a fever
S27E14_655#and, um, then she got shot in the face.
S27E14_658#Oh, wow. Hettie, you've had such a sad life.
S27E14_661#But you know what? That's gonna turn around
S27E14_664#when I show the world what it's missing in you.
S27E14_666#Well, I don't know if the world's gonna get me,
S27E14_669#but, child, it sure feels good to know that you do.
S27E14_672#You're having a moment with someone
S27E14_674#who has so few moments.
S27E14_676#This will never be forgotten.
S27E14_679#Oh, baby girl, I feel like I'm back home in poorest Appalachia.
S27E14_682#Thank you.
S27E14_685#Okay. And three, two, one...
S27E14_691#*Oh, Barnes & Noble*
S27E14_696#*Oh, I am sorry to see*
S27E14_700#*That your store*
S27E14_702#*Has been shuttered*
S27E14_706#*I miss your bathroom policy* 
S27E14_712#*I would sleep in your stalls* 
S27E14_717#*For many a long day*
S27E14_720#It's lovely, but I want you to know
S27E14_722#I've-I've truly come to hate music.
S27E14_725#That is so sad.
S27E14_727#I wanted to arrange a concert in Springfield Park.
S27E14_729#We needed the school's lights and sound system.
S27E14_732#Lights? Sweetie, you don't know a Fresnel from a gobo.
S27E14_735#Well, I think you'll help me every way you can.
S27E14_738#And why, pray tell, is that?
S27E14_740#Because deep down, there's still a part of you
S27E14_742#that remembers music can be magical.
S27E14_745#You're right.
S27E14_746#I can't bear to kill your passion.
S27E14_748#It will live at least until third grade,
S27E14_751#when you get Mrs. Ortner.
S27E14_753#So, I got back together with Jeff.
S27E14_756#Then, of course, I realized there was a reason we broke up.
S27E14_760#That sounds awful, and you look stupid doing it.
S27E14_784#Hettie, Hettie, I have a surprise for you!
S27E14_788#Oh, well, barbecue my bedbugs.
S27E14_789#That is glorious.
S27E14_792#To pay for it, I sold my Malibu Stacys.
S27E14_795#Which, from a feminist perspective, was long overdue.
S27E14_798#But I have a Ken that I'm transitioning to a Stacy.
S27E14_801#Try it on, try it on, try it on!
S27E14_803#I heard you the second time!
S27E14_807#Why, thank you, Your Majesty,
S27E14_809#I will have another cup of soda.
S27E14_811#- Lis, Lis, Lis. - What?!
S27E14_813#I've seen you like this before, and it ends badly.
S27E14_815#She is gonna break your heart.
S27E14_817#And your heart's as tough as a soap bubble.
S27E14_819#Remember how upset you got over that dead plant?
S27E14_822#Oh. It's the seven-month anniversary of that.
S27E14_826#Oh, geez, here we go again.
S27E14_828#Ugh. You know what, Bart? Just get out!
S27E14_830#And get Dad's keys and drive us to the radio station.
S27E14_833#And then get out! Wait until we're done.
S27E14_835#Then drive us back. Then get out!
S27E14_840#Damn it!
S27E14_845#Hello, Homer. I need to do the laundry.
S27E14_847#Uh, uh, I'll do it! Oh.
S27E14_851#You idiot. Now we'll always have to do the laundry!
S27E14_854#I'll do it wrong so she'll never ask again.
S27E14_857#Homer, you're a genius!
S27E14_858#Thanks, brain!
S27E14_860#Oh, I'm not your brain. I'm a blood clot.
S27E14_865#Okay. I'm goin' in.
S27E14_867#Thank God I never put in that insulation.
S27E14_877#I glide silently through the wall.
S27E14_881#Silently, ever silently.
S27E14_888#Ooh, rogue nails! Oh.
S27E14_889#Hot pipe!
S27E14_893#Gah. It's... Oh.
S27E14_894#Rough tongue! Aah!
S27E14_900#Oh, that's just...
S27E14_903#Aw, crap.
S27E14_907#Sure am glad we don't have a horse.
S27E14_911#Welcome back to Mountain Trax.
S27E14_914#I'm here today with the one and only Miss Hettie Mae Boggs,
S27E14_917#the baby of the Boggs Family.
S27E14_919#Well, I'm a little big for a baby.
S27E14_922#Although my mother did have a 21-pounder.
S27E14_924#Charming. Does anyone on this station talk
S27E14_926#like they're not at a funeral?
S27E14_928#No. I'm afraid we all do.
S27E14_930#So, Hettie, you're doing a concert tonight.
S27E14_932#Yes, she is.
S27E14_933#Could you tell our listeners
S27E14_935#why you didn't perform with your older brothers and sisters?
S27E14_937#I mean, they would ask me to. They would...
S27E14_939#They'd say, "Hettie, come over here,
S27E14_941#pick up a banjo and play a song with us."
S27E14_942#And, um, I don't know.
S27E14_944#I'd say, "No, I'm happy just to sit down by the creek
S27E14_947#and do my heroin." You know?
S27E14_948#Wait. What?
S27E14_950#Is it also true you've been discovered by,
S27E14_951#and then turned your back on,
S27E14_953#well-meaning supporters time and time again?
S27E14_956#Uh, yes, yeah, that is a pattern I adhere to,
S27E14_958#and do you have any OxyContin?
S27E14_960#Now, if you got some, you don't have to say yes.
S27E14_962#You just got to blink.
S27E14_963#Maybe we should take a break.
S27E14_965#For the record, I'm not blinking.
S27E14_968#He's holding. He just won't share.
S27E14_970#No, no, Hettie, please tell me that you're rehabilitated.
S27E14_972#Please tell me that you're talking about heroin
S27E14_975#so that no one else will follow in your footsteps.
S27E14_977#Please reassure me because I am frightened.
S27E14_980#Oh, baby girl, I wouldn't let you down.
S27E14_982#You and me-- we get each other, yeah?
S27E14_984#But if I don't get something sweet,
S27E14_986#I might shoot someone in the face.
S27E14_989#Are you saying that you shot your parents in the face?
S27E14_991#I don't know.
S27E14_993#That's not really the kind of thing you remember.
S27E14_994#You know what I mean?
S27E14_996#All right, I'm gonna go now. Bye.
S27E14_999#Lis, if she shoots your face off tomorrow,
S27E14_1001#just remember this is what it looks like.
S27E14_1008#She is not going to let me down!
S27E14_1009#She is not!
S27E14_1011#I am saving her.
S27E14_1012#Okay, you've convinced me.
S27E14_1014#You're out of your mind.
S27E14_1016#So, how'd it go at the co-ed kickball championship?
S27E14_1017#All a lie!
S27E14_1019#Lisa's been hiding a dangerous heroin addict in her closet!
S27E14_1023#You were hiding her in your closet, too!
S27E14_1025#I was renting week-to-week!
S27E14_1031#Homer, do you know what was going on in our house?
S27E14_1033#Why are you asking meow-- I mean, me now?
S27E14_1035#Homer, I know about the cat.
S27E14_1037#I also know about the dog. He's fine.
S27E14_1041#- I¡¯ve been taking care of everything. - You knew?
S27E14_1044#It was pretty sexy pretending you were toolsy.
S27E14_1047#But Lisa let a strange Kentucky lady live in our house
S27E14_1050#without our permission.
S27E14_1052#Well, now I don't know where she is, and I believed in her,
S27E14_1054#and we have a concert in 30 minutes.
S27E14_1056#Oh, honey, we'll find her.
S27E14_1058#You entertain the audience till we get there.
S27E14_1061#Okay, I'll play my sax!
S27E14_1063#Well, that'll turn a disappointed crowd into a lynch mob.
S27E14_1065#Shut up.
S27E14_1067#Okay, if you want to find this woman,
S27E14_1069#and I recommend you don't, here's a little clue.
S27E14_1072#Hettie usually smells like radiator booze.
S27E14_1075#To Cletus country!
S27E14_1078#Hettie, we need to get you up,
S27E14_1081#run you through a car wash and get you to that concert.
S27E14_1084#You hush up now!
S27E14_1086#Fortunately for you, I'm fluent in drunk.
S27E14_1088#Now, come on, get up.
S27E14_1090#You're gonna get up and...
S27E14_1095#and backtalk.
S27E14_1099#Nobody tell me what to do.
S27E14_1102#Not you, not the po-lice.
S27E14_1104#Not even the police.
S27E14_1106#Cletus, why did you give her a shotgun?
S27E14_1110#Hey, I do not give anyone firearms.
S27E14_1113#Now, she must've taken that out the umbrella stand.
S27E14_1116#Oh, your little girl's been so good to me.
S27E14_1119#I can't shoot you in the face.
S27E14_1120#I'll just make you deaf for a week.
S27E14_1123#Oh! I have church tomorrow.
S27E14_1124#Can you do the other?
S27E14_1126#Thank you!
S27E14_1130#Give it up! She isn't coming!
S27E14_1137#You've just made a very powerful enemy-- NPR.
S27E14_1140#Our revenge is made possible by listeners like you.
S27E14_1148#Hello, Springfield!
S27E14_1151#They're gone, and I am never, ever gonna forgive you.

S27E14_1188#*Oh, honey, I've been down*
S27E14_1193#*And down is where I think I'm gonna stay*
S27E14_1199#Ugh. Okay, you can sleep it off on our couch.
S27E14_1202#Well, thank you, sweetheart.
S27E14_1204#Hey, what time do you do your couch gags?
S27E14_1206#Around 11:00 in the morning. You'll be fine.
S27E14_1218#*In the house next door to Flanders*

S27E15_127#You mean you didn't use the app last week
S27E15_129#to get your Slammin' Salmon line number?
S27E15_131#What are you, Amish?
S27E15_136#All right, time to thin out the herd.
S27E15_141#Attention, bathers,
S27E15_143#This is water park president Cal A. Bunga.
S27E15_146#Do not panic, but the pools are infested
S27E15_150#with those tiny fish that swim up your wiener.
S27E15_152#Get out of the way!
S27E15_155#Again, do not panic.
S27E15_157#If you think a wiener fish has entered your dingus,
S27E15_161#the only cure is to roll around naked in the snow.
S27E15_171#Uh, Lou, I need a big favor from you.
S27E15_174#Oh, man. I... They don't train you for this at the academy.
S27E15_177#Well, they should.
S27E15_187#Yes!
S27E15_197#Oh, dear god! Bio breach!
S27E15_208#That poor raccoon!
S27E15_210#Isn't anyone gonna do anything?
S27E15_213#He committed nature's greatest crime: Coming inside.
S27E15_221#No heartbeat.
S27E15_223#Finally, a chance to use my online CPR training.
S27E15_226#One, two, three, four, five.
S27E15_229#One, two, three, four, five.
S27E15_231#Lisa has a boyfriend!
S27E15_233#Lisa has a boyfriend!
S27E15_235#Oh, a boyfriend?
S27E15_237#And raccoons are such good providers.
S27E15_239#Come on, come on.
S27E15_241#You have so much more trash to eat.
S27E15_243#Steal one more breath, noble bandit.
S27E15_248#It worked. I saved you.
S27E15_251#My first rescue.
S27E15_253#And my first real kiss.
S27E15_256#She'd have chosen me if I was wearing a real bathing suit.
S27E15_261#For once, a life saved at a Springfield water park,
S27E15_264#where a quick-thinking second grader
S27E15_267#performed emergency CPR on a drowning nuisance animal,
S27E15_271#while dozens of unheroic onlookers just stood around.
S27E15_274#Where was channel six news?
S27E15_276#Filming gas pumps and their ever-changing prices.
S27E15_279#Which accomplishes what? I don't know.
S27E15_283#There's eight minutes left.
S27E15_285#Uh, did we do gas prices?
S27E15_286#Yes!
S27E15_290#We saw you on the picture radio.
S27E15_292#They chyroned your name.
S27E15_294#They described you as "Local girl."
S27E15_296#Hubba, hubba.
S27E15_298#They sure got that right.
S27E15_300#Lisa, it looks like you're the perfect student 
S27E15_302#to look after Nibbles the hamster here during spring break.
S27E15_304#I'd take him with me,
S27E15_306#But I'm doing jell-o shots with former students.
S27E15_309#This spring break, I'm gonna go wild with responsibility!
S27E15_312#My dad's spending spring break in a cage, too.
S27E15_316#And for saving that raccoon, I got the opposite of teasing.
S27E15_318#I bet the Germans have a word for it, 
S27E15_320#like, uh, Gerstronkenplatzen or something.
S27E15_324#I wish the Germans had a word for this terrible traffic.
S27E15_327#And so ends the moment being about me.
S27E15_329#What's going on, chief?
S27E15_331#Oh, nasty car crash.
S27E15_333#Can't let traffic through
S27E15_335#until the cleanup crew mops up this mess.
S27E15_337#Which is a problem,
S27E15_339#Because they're stuck in traffic behind you.
S27E15_341#Okay, who did that?!
S27E15_343#We need to get home.
S27E15_345#I left my father-in-law on the sofa.
S27E15_347#He's got to be turned.
S27E15_348#Yeah, well, that ain't gonna happen.
S27E15_350#Not unless you clean up this accident scene.
S27E15_352#Actually, seriously, could you do that?
S27E15_354#Hmm, I don't know.
S27E15_356#I'm one of those people who doesn't like
S27E15_358#being traumatized by horrifying sights.
S27E15_360#Marge, do you know why I became a cop?
S27E15_362#If you do, could you tell me?
S27E15_364#'cause it's-it's really dangerous.
S27E15_366#B-but these crime scene cleanups, they're totally safe.
S27E15_369#All the bad people are dead or, uh, at large.
S27E15_371#So give it a shot.
S27E15_373#Please. Please, Mom.
S27E15_378#Oh, all right.
S27E15_389#There you go. Spick and span.
S27E15_393#Wow, you even made the homeless guy look nice.
S27E15_396#Yeah, still crazy though.
S27E15_398#You know, Marge, uh, you ever want Some fast extra cash, 
S27E15_401#we are always looking for crime scene cleaner-uppers.
S27E15_404#You know what they say: Crime always pays.
S27E15_408#Plus, you can keep any money you find,
S27E15_410#and any jewelry that isn't monogrammed.
S27E15_419#Hello, little girl.
S27E15_421#Oh, does your hamster have Tyzzer's Disease?
S27E15_423#That would've been interesting,
S27E15_425#But I swabbed him for Tyzzer's and it came up negative.
S27E15_428#My. You certainly know a lot about animals.
S27E15_431#That's just it, I do.
S27E15_433#I saved a raccoon's life the other day.
S27E15_435#It was the best feeling I've ever had.
S27E15_437#Is there any way I could work in your office?
S27E15_439#I mean, as an intern or anything?
S27E15_442#Oh, do you know how many people walk in here every day
S27E15_445#looking for just such a thing?
S27E15_446#A lot, I bet.
S27E15_448#No, it's never happened.
S27E15_450#Grab a clean smock and follow me.
S27E15_453#Oh, okay!
S27E15_456#I can't find a clean smock.
S27E15_458#Then your first job is to clean the smocks.
S27E15_462#I'm ready, Dr. Budgie.
S27E15_464#Oh, it's a shame to ruin such a clean smock,
S27E15_467#But, uh, let's go.
S27E15_475#This is heaven.
S27E15_477#You got to help me, doc.
S27E15_479#My pet ferret has lost its terrible stink!
S27E15_481#Well, that won't do.
S27E15_484#Let me have a go at jump-starting the old stink gland.
S27E15_487#Lisa, my dear, can you restrain the ferret?
S27E15_490#It would be my honor.
S27E15_494#Clear!
S27E15_497#We have stink lines!
S27E15_499#Well done, Lisa.
S27E15_501#Heaven!
S27E15_509#All right, veggie kibble for Daisy here.
S27E15_512#Chairman meow is having surgery tomorrow,
S27E15_514#So only liquid for you.
S27E15_516#And no more food for you, Mr. Snake,
S27E15_518#Until you finish shedding your skin.
S27E15_522#Oh. You have.
S27E15_525#Dr. Budgie, I'm really enjoying cleaning out these cages.
S27E15_528#No, really, I am, but are there any jobs that are more exciting?
S27E15_530#Absolutely.
S27E15_532#You can hobble these crickets.
S27E15_535#We have a hungry chameleon who's slowing down with age,
S27E15_538#but he still loves the thrill of the hunt.
S27E15_540#Mm. Anything more life or deathy?
S27E15_542#I could take the animals' temperature.
S27E15_544#I know what that means, and I am up for it.
S27E15_547#Oh, Lisa, slow down.
S27E15_549#Do you know how many awkward courses I had to take
S27E15_552#before they let me put my arm inside a horse?
S27E15_554#I understand.
S27E15_556#I just feel like I could be doing more.
S27E15_558#Oh, you remind me of a certain young man
S27E15_561#growing up in Stratfordshire-on-corningwell.
S27E15_563#He, too, was impatient.
S27E15_565#Always thinking he could do more.
S27E15_567#Was that you?
S27E15_569#No. If that was me, I would have said "Me."
S27E15_572#This eager beaver had to leave veterinary school
S27E15_576#and become-- ugh-- a people doctor.
S27E15_579#And with the 27th pick of the 14th round
S27E15_582#of the NHL draft, the Phoenix Coyotes select...
S27E15_585#Lubochuck, Lubochuck, Lubochuck, Lubochuck.
S27E15_587#...C¨¦dric b¨¦langer.
S27E15_589#But Lubochuck.
S27E15_591#Homie, I think we need a new ceiling fan.
S27E15_593#The old one doesn't seem safe.
S27E15_597#It's fine. And it saves us money on haircuts.
S27E15_600#Not bad, 
S27E15_602#but I miss the social aspects of the barbershop.
S27E15_606#The St. Louis Blues are now on the clock.
S27E15_609#Lubochuck, Lubochuck, Lubochuck, Lubochuck.
S27E15_612#Springfield PD.
S27E15_614#PD... Police department!
S27E15_616#Ha! I just got that.
S27E15_618#Chief, chief, this is Marge Simpson.
S27E15_621#I think I'd like to do some of those crime scene cleanups.
S27E15_623#Oh, great, great.
S27E15_624#Hey, I got a job for you right here.
S27E15_626#Uh, murder-suicide.
S27E15_628#Or possibly a suicide-murder.
S27E15_630#Just bring a mop and your imagination.
S27E15_632#Hey, it can't be worse than what I've seen.
S27E15_635#Homer, I told you not to eat chili out of the colander!
S27E15_638#Uh, it's pronounced "Calendar."
S27E15_641#What's the matter, little guy?
S27E15_643#You haven't touched your berries.
S27E15_645#Do you need aphids for flavor?
S27E15_648#Aphids.
S27E15_650#Lisa, could you come here for a moment?
S27E15_652#At last.
S27E15_656#I'm trying to give this saint bernard a shot,
S27E15_658#but my hands are a little shaky.
S27E15_660#I had an extra gallon of tea for lunch.
S27E15_662#Oh, my.
S27E15_664#If I hold him, do you think
S27E15_666#you could attend to the matter of the needle?
S27E15_668#Of course!
S27E15_671#Careful, careful.
S27E15_674#A single millimeter either way
S27E15_676#would not make much of a difference.
S27E15_679#Huh. Why am I not feeling
S27E15_681#the same rush I did with the raccoon?
S27E15_685#There it is!
S27E15_691#Be careful, Mrs. S.
S27E15_694#I've never seen an angel-dust-for-guns swap go so wrong.
S27E15_697#Hey, a mess is a mess.
S27E15_709#Let me start with this filthy crime scene tape.
S27E15_716#Yarr, is the doctor in, miss?
S27E15_718#Little goldie here is listing hard to starboard.
S27E15_722#I fear he may have tangled with the wrong plastic diver.
S27E15_725#Hmm. Could be fin rot.
S27E15_727#Oh, no, not the big F.
S27E15_730#Do what you must. I'll say my good-byes.
S27E15_734#You were more wife to me than any woman I ever knew.
S27E15_737#Captain, the diagnosis of fin rot
S27E15_740#is not the death sentence it used to be.
S27E15_742#A couple drops of medicine in the water, and he'll be fine.
S27E15_748#Yarr, that's amazing!
S27E15_751#Eh, I've just got one more little problem.
S27E15_755#He, uh... He ate me car keys.
S27E15_761#Hurry, doc! His lungs are full of seltzer!
S27E15_773#Homie? Notice anything?
S27E15_782#Um, are you having an affair?
S27E15_784#What? No.
S27E15_786#I bought a new ceiling fan. Huh?
S27E15_789#Ooh, I thought the air felt a little more lively.
S27E15_791#But where did you get the money?
S27E15_794#Actually, I made a little extra by cleaning up crime scenes.
S27E15_797#What? Poor Marge.
S27E15_800#I heard that can really mess you...
S27E15_802#Oh, baby, that cool air is sweet!
S27E15_804#...Up.
S27E15_806#Are you sure you're not living a waking nightmare?
S27E15_809#No. Not one little bit.
S27E15_811#And I get the police discount on cleaning supplies.
S27E15_814#I can finally clean grampa's dentures.
S27E15_817#Yeah, I got popcorn in there from Kramer vs. Kramer.
S27E15_820#I was rooting for Kramer,
S27E15_822#But was dismayed when kramer finally won.
S27E15_825#That's a twist I didn't see Kramer.
S27E15_831#Happy birthday, martin. Where's the gift table?
S27E15_834#right over there, my friend.
S27E15_847#Some zoo. Where are the rental strollers?
S27E15_849#Actually, it's not so bad.
S27E15_850#The animals are healthy.
S27E15_853#A couple of paddock scrapes, but nothing overly concerning.
S27E15_856#Oh, knock it off. You're not a vet.
S27E15_858#You're a glorified cage scrubber.
S27E15_860#Dr. Budgie depends upon me!
S27E15_862#I have felt the cold breath of Kennel Cough in my face.
S27E15_865#I have seen tabbies that were more tick than cat.
S27E15_868#I know why the caged dog scoots.
S27E15_871#So when your lizard loses its tail,
S27E15_874#You're gonna need me to tell you it's gonna grow back.
S27E15_878#Want some peanuts, Mr. Elephant?
S27E15_880#Uh, it's a goat, not an elephant,
S27E15_882#And those are shrimp, not peanuts.
S27E15_883#And that goat is allergic to shrimp!
S27E15_886#Your breath smells like "Don't drink that."
S27E15_890#Milhouse, give me your epipen!
S27E15_891#You're not a professional.
S27E15_893#I am a self-selected unpaid veterinary intern.
S27E15_896#Now let me practice my craft!
S27E15_906#Hey, he's as good as new.
S27E15_908#Look at him play with the kids!
S27E15_912#See, Bart? Life or death.
S27E15_913#I make the choice.
S27E15_915#Okay, time to cut the cake.
S27E15_922#That's my patient.
S27E15_926#Guess what, sweetie.
S27E15_928#I'm wearing my snuggle socks.
S27E15_931#They're compression socks from your heart surgery.
S27E15_933#All the same...
S27E15_938#I'm not in the mood.
S27E15_940#What?! You've never said that before!
S27E15_943#I've thought it three times.
S27E15_945#Each time was after a burrito-eating contest.
S27E15_947#But I won!
S27E15_949#What's wrong?
S27E15_951#It's just that seeing you, lying down,
S27E15_954#Reminds me of this bloated corpse I had to clean up today.
S27E15_958#Hey, I look damn good for someone who eats the crap I do.
S27E15_961#Maybe we should just go to sleep.
S27E15_963#I wasn't done with my drink.
S27E15_966#Would you like my itty-bitty booze light?
S27E15_970#I've never seen him like this. He's so listless.
S27E15_973#Who's lost the urge to kill?
S27E15_975#Who's lost the urge to kill?
S27E15_977#I'll tell you what's wrong with him: You.
S27E15_979#What? Me?!
S27E15_981#This dog is badly behind on his shots.
S27E15_983#He's displaying the symptoms of early onset parvo.
S27E15_986#I'm confiscating your dog.
S27E15_988#And, you, get out!
S27E15_990#Smithers, I've been shamed.
S27E15_992#Prepare a thimble of ice cream.
S27E15_994#Some people don't deserve to own pets.
S27E15_996#And you get to decide who?
S27E15_999#Don't fold your arms at me.
S27E15_1001#Lis, look at yourself.
S27E15_1003#You've become so arrogant, you've forgotten who you are.
S27E15_1005#And even worse, you've forgotten Nibbles!
S27E15_1010#Nibbles!
S27E15_1012#My pet! My responsibility!
S27E15_1014#My homework!
S27E15_1017#Matted hair, dry tongue...
S27E15_1019#Is this true, Lisa?
S27E15_1021#Did you let this happen to a creature in your care?
S27E15_1024#I'm so sorry.
S27E15_1026#I'm so, so sorry.
S27E15_1029#Pet hamsters need to be played with regularly,
S27E15_1031#or they feel abandoned.
S27E15_1033#And that can lead to stress polyps on the heart.
S27E15_1036#The heart is the seat of love, Lisa.
S27E15_1039#If you'd gone to veterinary school, you'd know that.
S27E15_1042#I've got no choice but to operate.
S27E15_1044#And I need your help.
S27E15_1046#You still want me to help you after I was so arrogant?
S27E15_1050#Lisa, arrogance is what made the British Empire.
S27E15_1053#Then lost it.
S27E15_1055#Then pretended it didn't happen.
S27E15_1059#Well, we've done all we can.
S27E15_1062#The next 24 hours will be crucial.
S27E15_1064#oh, he's gone.
S27E15_1066#No, no, no.
S27E15_1068#He can't be dead!
S27E15_1070#He can't!
S27E15_1073#I thought we could save every animal if we just cared enough.
S27E15_1077#Okay, Marge, sweetie, look at this one.
S27E15_1079#See, Marge?
S27E15_1081#The baby laughs every time the toaster pops.
S27E15_1084#It is pretty hysterical.
S27E15_1085#That's nice.
S27E15_1087#Nice? Something in you is dead, Marge,
S27E15_1090#and that's one crime scene you can't clean up.
S27E15_1093#And all for a fan.
S27E15_1095#A stupid ceiling fan that...
S27E15_1097#Oh, man, that's refreshing.
S27E15_1099#I want my Marge back.
S27E15_1102#Hello? What is it, boy?
S27E15_1104#I see.
S27E15_1106#Fine, Marge.
S27E15_1108#You sit here, watch your boob tube, have a beer.
S27E15_1111#That's not how Homer Simpson does things.
S27E15_1113#I have to go help Lisa!
S27E15_1116#Lisa?
S27E15_1118#Wait! Wait, I'm coming with you.
S27E15_1125#No answer.
S27E15_1127#I guess we got to do this ourselves.
S27E15_1131#Oh, geez.
S27E15_1134#All right, get some paper towels, boys.
S27E15_1139#Lisa.
S27E15_1142#Oh, mom, he trusted me as only a hamster can!
S27E15_1147#If there's one thing I'll always clean up,
S27E15_1149#it's my baby's tears.
S27E15_1152#- You would've never let anything - I should've 
S27E15_1153#- happen to him.  - been here for you. 
S27E15_1154#-I was too busy being dead inside... - Wherever he went, 
S27E15_1155#I hope they have hamster balls.
S27E15_1157#...doing I don't know what!
S27E15_1159#But I'm here now, and I'll never leave.
S27E15_1163#Well, I'll be.
S27E15_1165#Lisa's learning about death helped Marge feel again.
S27E15_1168#Yes, a perfect dovetail.
S27E15_1171#Thank you for curing Walter Pigeon here.
S27E15_1172#I can't afford to pay you, 
S27E15_1174#but I can give you front row seats to my magic show.
S27E15_1176#The theme is boxing.
S27E15_1178#Sounds marvelous.
S27E15_1180#Oh, yeah, no. Come on, it is.
S27E15_1182#I want to thank everyone
S27E15_1184#for coming to Nibbles's funeral today.
S27E15_1186#This is president Cal A. Bunga.
S27E15_1188#On this sad occasion,
S27E15_1191#the school flag will be flying at half-ass.
S27E15_1193#Bart!
S27E15_1195#I know that this is an especially hard time
S27E15_1198#for the other classroom pets,
S27E15_1200#including Mrs. Nibbles, Shelly the turtle,
S27E15_1203#Sally Mander, Hamilton fish and Willie's chicken.
S27E15_1206#Willie, where is your chicken?
S27E15_1208#It was either him or me!
S27E15_1209#I see.
S27E15_1211#Please stand for Nibbles's final journey.
S27E16_73#over a field of ripe Doritos.
S27E16_75#While these--
S27E16_77#Look, I'm just gonna say what we're all thinking--
S27E16_80#Store eggs are yellow.
S27E16_83#They're yellow eggs, Marge. Yellow.
S27E16_86#Why do you always think about what you don't have?
S27E16_89#Has anyone ever thought about what they do have?
S27E16_91#- Have you? - Not that much.
S27E16_93#- Have you? - Nope!
S27E16_94#Have you?
S27E16_98#Boy, I won't live long enough to teach you about sex,
S27E16_101#but I'll be damned if I don't show you how to steal eggs.
S27E16_108#Okay, son, stay sharp in there.
S27E16_110#If chickens are known for two things,
S27E16_112#it's bravery and intelligence.
S27E16_118#This is what we're after.
S27E16_125#I got one.
S27E16_126#Hurry, fat-ass!
S27E16_139#How can idiots say there's no god
S27E16_141#when a species that evolved from dinosaurs
S27E16_143#feeds us their unfertilized babies?
S27E16_146#Ugh, if I could lay eggs like these,
S27E16_148#I'd never leave my bedroom.
S27E16_154#The farmer!
S27E16_156#Homer Simpson, I am going to enjoy finding it in my heart
S27E16_159#to forgive you for this.
S27E16_164#Well, there's no getting past that.
S27E16_166#We may not be able to steal Flanders' eggs,
S27E16_169#but we can steal his idea.
S27E16_171#You mean get our own chickens,
S27E16_173#feed them, love them and eat their eggs?
S27E16_175#Check. Mate.
S27E16_181#Urban poultry farming is a great way
S27E16_183#to reduce our carbon footprint.
S27E16_185#Or maybe increase it, I'm not sure.
S27E16_187#But they're so cute!
S27E16_188#Now, don't get attached.
S27E16_190#I'm about to cut them open to scoop out the eggs.
S27E16_192#No, look!
S27E16_194#They're already laying.
S27E16_197#Now, what lays bacon?
S27E16_200#One... Two... Eggs!
S27E16_206#- Delicious. - Delicious.
S27E16_208#These don't taste right.
S27E16_210#You're crazy, these are the best eggs I've ever eaten.
S27E16_212#No.
S27E16_214#No, something is missing.
S27E16_224#Bart's right.
S27E16_226#They're not as good as the eggs we stole from Flanders.
S27E16_230#The eggs... we stole... from Flanders!
S27E16_233#You don't think they tasted so great
S27E16_235#because they were stolen, do you?
S27E16_236#Only one way to find out.
S27E16_239#My potato chips!
S27E16_242#Okay, first, a chip from the control bag.
S27E16_245#Now the stolen bag.
S27E16_250#It's true.
S27E16_252#Theft equals flavor.
S27E16_257#Ah, forget it.
S27E16_258#Just take 'em.
S27E16_260#You can't just give them to us!
S27E16_262#They only taste good if we steal them!
S27E16_263#Keep chasing!
S27E16_265#It improves the flavor!
S27E16_267#Sure, sure, whatever works for you.
S27E16_272#I guess we don't need our chickens anymore.
S27E16_274#Don't worry, I've already found a research facility
S27E16_277#that will raise them humanely.
S27E16_279#I wasn't worried about that.
S27E16_287#If you're going to eat the chickens, don't tell the girl.
S27E16_291#Oh, no, these chickens are here to advance the cause of science.
S27E16_299#Look at all those lab coats.
S27E16_304#At Exploration Incorporated,
S27E16_306#Our mission is to help humanity make the next big leap.
S27E16_309#That's so fascinating.
S27E16_311#When did you incorporate?
S27E16_312#We are preparing to launch
S27E16_314#the first privately-funded, manned mission to Mars.
S27E16_317#You're going to mars?
S27E16_319#That's incredible.
S27E16_320#Uh, yes.
S27E16_322#How do you plan to solve the problem
S27E16_324#of eyeball explosion when you take off your space helmet?
S27E16_326#Uh, you leave your helmet on.
S27E16_328#Hmm, these guys seem legit.
S27E16_330#This video will explain our revolutionary vision.
S27E16_337#Human beings are explorers.
S27E16_341#It's what we do.
S27E16_344#It's who we are.
S27E16_346#But since our world holds no more secrets,
S27E16_349#we must journey... to Mars.
S27E16_351#Government agencies like NASA say it will be decades
S27E16_354#before we set foot on the red planet.
S27E16_357#At Exploration Incorporated, we're working hard to establish
S27E16_361#a human settlement on Mars ten years from today.
S27E16_364#Soon a select group of colonists
S27E16_366#will leave earth forever
S27E16_368#and become the first residents of another world.
S27E16_371#Will you be one of them?
S27E16_384#Exploration Incorporated.
S27E16_386#Never stop exploring.
S27E16_389#What about those Mars nutjobs?
S27E16_391#Who wants to take a one-way trip to 
S27E16_393#a barren, lifeless rock?
S27E16_395#Yeah, in a couple years, we'll have
S27E16_397#a perfectly good barren, lifeless rock right here.
S27E16_399#This guy gets it.
S27E16_401#Well, this mission really gives me hope.
S27E16_404#I'm tired of nothing but bad news about the future.
S27E16_407#Yes, but to travel to another planet,
S27E16_409#knowing you can never come back,
S27E16_411#you'd have to be pretty sad.
S27E16_413#Aniston sad.
S27E16_415#I'm not sad, I'm inspired.
S27E16_417#That's why I volunteered this afternoon.
S27E16_418#What?!
S27E16_420#The mission leaves in ten years.
S27E16_422#I'll be 18, and I'm going to Mars.
S27E16_424#No way, young lady.
S27E16_426#We cannot afford to send you to Mars.
S27E16_427#It's free.
S27E16_429#Cheaper than college.
S27E16_430#- No. - No!
S27E16_434#You volunteered to go to Mars and leave your family?
S27E16_436#Forever?
S27E16_438#This mission could save humanity.
S27E16_441#What if I was the first person to set foot on another world?
S27E16_444#I'd never be able to hug my daughter again.
S27E16_446#They thought of that.
S27E16_448#They give a virtual hug machine to every family back home.
S27E16_451#That does look pretty snuggly.
S27E16_453#No!
S27E16_455#I think this could be my true purpose.
S27E16_456#Just let me try out.
S27E16_458#They might not even pick me.
S27E16_459#I mean, I'd pick me, but...
S27E16_461#Absolutely not.
S27E16_462#You are grounded.
S27E16_464#You are confined to this planet.
S27E16_466#And its moon.
S27E16_471#Uh, honey?
S27E16_473#A word before you continue parenting?
S27E16_475#What?
S27E16_477#In all my years of living with the female species,
S27E16_479#I've learned one thing.
S27E16_481#When they want to do something totally insane,
S27E16_484#Your only move is to support them 100%.
S27E16_487#Oh, come on, that's ridiculous.
S27E16_489#Really? Have you ever done anything
S27E16_491#just because someone told you not to?
S27E16_495#You cannot marry Homer Simpson.
S27E16_497#I forbid it.
S27E16_500#And now you got me.
S27E16_506#Oh, my gosh.
S27E16_508#We both know Lisa's not going to Mars.
S27E16_510#It's just a little girl's fantasy.
S27E16_512#But if you forbid someone from doing something,
S27E16_514#they'll want to do it more.
S27E16_516#So we should just pretend we're cool
S27E16_518#with our daughter abandoning us forever?
S27E16_519#Exactly.
S27E16_522#It's an old relationship move I call "Turning into the skid."
S27E16_524#If you just play along,
S27E16_527#sooner or later Lisa will lose interest in her terrible idea.
S27E16_531#You haven't used that trick on me, have you?
S27E16_535#No, no. I learned it from observing other marriages.
S27E16_538#Ones less fantastic than ours.
S27E16_544#"Turning into the skid."
S27E16_549#You know, I looked at a map,
S27E16_551#and Mars is just one planet over.
S27E16_554#If you really want to try out for this mission, I support you.
S27E16_557#Really? Thanks, Mom!
S27E16_559#If they choose me to be a colonist,
S27E16_561#I could make jazz the dominant music form
S27E16_563#of a whole new planet.
S27E16_566#That's exactly where jazz belongs.
S27E16_571#Way to turn into the skid, baby.
S27E16_573#Now watch Lisa lose interest in Mars,
S27E16_575#Just as sure as you gave up
S27E16_577#on opening that g-rated comedy club.
S27E16_580#I thought gentle jollies was a great idea.
S27E16_583#Oh, not great. Amazing.
S27E16_586#Now that I think about it,
S27E16_588#that idea did have a lot of problems.
S27E16_594#Greetings, candidates.
S27E16_596#The testing that begins today will determine
S27E16_598#which of you have the necessary skills to thrive on Mars.
S27E16_601#Think of how satisfying it will feel
S27E16_602#to stand in the Valles Marineris
S27E16_604#And thunder-chug a blue bronco energy drink.
S27E16_607#- I'm sorry, blue bronco? - Wait, thunder-chug?
S27E16_609#Blue Bronco is just one of this mission's many corporate partners.
S27E16_612#Because this is a privately funded entrepreneurial mission,
S27E16_615#we've teamed up with some of America's most exciting brands.
S27E16_618#We're talking Mega-Charge batteries,
S27E16_620#Fantasy-Lunatics.com,
S27E16_621#Trudge-Rite Work Boots,
S27E16_622#Draft-Pigs.
S27E16_624#And who here likes Fig Glutens?
S27E16_630#What? The Fig seeds get caught in my adult braces.
S27E16_635#Oh, I should not have given away my dog, man.
S27E16_640#Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god.
S27E16_643#Oh, it's hurting my...
S27E16_645#Oh! I can't feel my...
S27E16_651#Principal Skinner?
S27E16_653#What brings you on this mission
S27E16_655#to make mankind a two-planet species?
S27E16_657#Mars is the ultimate field trip.
S27E16_660#And all they sell at the gift shop is immortality.
S27E16_662#Also, I'm drowning in debt.
S27E16_665#Well, I hope to establish a planet of perfect equality-ment.
S27E16_668#On Mars, you are my servant.
S27E16_670#Uh, well, well, either way is good, really.
S27E16_674#And then, finally,
S27E16_676#I got to spend some quality time
S27E16_678#with the oxygen reclaimers.
S27E16_680#You must've felt like the belle of the ball.
S27E16_683#You said if I supported Lisa's crazy idea,
S27E16_685#she'd lose interest.
S27E16_686#Oh, Marge.
S27E16_688#You'll never understand the female mind.
S27E16_690#We're just getting started.
S27E16_692#What more can we do?
S27E16_694#I've utilized my male mind to come up with
S27E16_696#a plan so supportive,
S27E16_699#Lisa will never want to do anything again.
S27E16_705#What are you guys doing here?
S27E16_708#We're trying out for Mars, too.
S27E16_710#We were so inspired by you being inspired.
S27E16_713#A family unit could be perfect for this mission.
S27E16_715#NASA would never have the guts
S27E16_717#to shoot a baby into space.
S27E16_720#And your father is a former astronaut.
S27E16_721#What an honor.
S27E16_723#Last time, I almost killed everybody.
S27E16_724#And what did you learn from that?
S27E16_726#Lessons, I guess.
S27E16_727#Okay.
S27E16_728#Mom, dad and Bart
S27E16_729#don't want to go to Mars.
S27E16_731#So this must be some sort of
S27E16_733#mind-game reverse super-fake-out.
S27E16_735#Poor Lisa.
S27E16_737#She is so faked out.
S27E16_739#And all I have to do is be patient.
S27E16_742#Pretty soon, they'll get sick of this and quit.
S27E16_744#I'm getting sick of this.
S27E16_746#I think I'll quit soon.
S27E16_748#It's just a matter of time.
S27E16_751#I wonder which one of these two guys is the one I quit to?
S27E16_753#We will now test your ability
S27E16_755#to handle close confinement.
S27E16_756#For the next week,
S27E16_758#you'll be living in the Martian habitat simulator.
S27E16_764#I'll man this station.
S27E16_769#Okay, mom.
S27E16_771#Since you're so excited to go to Mars,
S27E16_774#you'll be thrilled to start on
S27E16_776#the hab's daily maintenance procedures.
S27E16_781#"Nutrition zone sterilization sequence."
S27E16_784#That's just kitchen cleanup.
S27E16_785#Fun!
S27E16_786#No, no, no.
S27E16_788#Procedures aren't "fun."
S27E16_790#Sure, if you call them "procedures," they're a bore,
S27E16_793#but if you think of them as "chores,"
S27E16_795#They can be a blast!
S27E16_797#They're not chores!
S27E16_798#They're science!
S27E16_799#Ooh, there's even directions
S27E16_801#on how to properly clean this binder.
S27E16_806#Oh, no.
S27E16_808#You cannot like this more than me.
S27E16_816#Dinner is served!
S27E16_818#I rehydrated it with love.
S27E16_820#And recycled toilet water.
S27E16_825#So good, Marge!
S27E16_828#Well, today I tested nitrogen levels in our atmosphere.
S27E16_831#They were the same as yesterday.
S27E16_833#More toilet carrots, please!
S27E16_837#Can't sleep.
S27E16_841#My sleeping pod's too small.
S27E16_843#They have an expansion mode
S27E16_845#for morbidly obese astronauts.
S27E16_850#I know we're just here to fake-support our daughter,
S27E16_852#but you're pretty good at this space junk.
S27E16_854#Moms spend their whole lives
S27E16_856#obsessing over unlikely catastrophes.
S27E16_859#In space, that's what you're supposed to do.
S27E16_886#The hab study is complete.
S27E16_888#To all the male participants,
S27E16_890#your monumental incompetence
S27E16_892#has sullied and cheapened space forever.
S27E16_893#Now get out.
S27E16_894#Good. It's a stupid idea
S27E16_896#and I hope everyone dies.
S27E16_899#You're letting the martians in!
S27E16_902#I'm keeping the jumpsuit.
S27E16_904#Marge and Lisa, congratulations.
S27E16_906#You've both passed with flying colors
S27E16_908#and will be named finalists in our astronaut search.
S27E16_910#Marge, you're a revelation.
S27E16_912#Most of our candidates are of the egghead loner variety.
S27E16_915#Bookworms, teacher's pets,
S27E16_917#friendless middle children, that sort of thing.
S27E16_920#But you display an amazing ability
S27E16_922#to perform repetitive tasks without getting bored.
S27E16_925#Even our robotic arm gets a little cranky.
S27E16_928#That's two, Lorraine!
S27E16_931#May I talk to you in private, please?
S27E16_938#Admit it, the only reason you're here is to support me
S27E16_940#until I lose interest and quit.
S27E16_942#Well, I'm not going anywhere,
S27E16_944#so you can quit.
S27E16_946#Maybe I don't want to quit.
S27E16_949#Do you realize what a big deal it is to be a space colonist?
S27E16_951#Yes!
S27E16_953#That's why I want to do it!
S27E16_955#I think you don't like that I'm just as good at mars as you.
S27E16_958#Maybe even better.
S27E16_959#Ha! Hardly.
S27E16_961#All you are is a...
S27E16_963#a stay-at-hab space wife!
S27E16_967#Well, it looks like the ego has landed.
S27E16_970#You're the last person I would ever want to go to Mars with.
S27E16_972#In ten years.
S27E16_973#That's too bad,
S27E16_975#because I'm going with you
S27E16_977#In ten years.
S27E16_982#On mars, that would be a door slam!
S27E16_987#Sometimes I feel like Lisa has no respect for me.
S27E16_989#I know, I know.
S27E16_991#I'm finally good at something
S27E16_993#and she has to make it into a competition.
S27E16_995#That must be really hard for you.
S27E16_996#It is.
S27E16_998#I'm so sorry you have to go through this.
S27E16_1001#Thank you.
S27E16_1003#Mom's always trying to hold me back!
S27E16_1005#I know, I know.
S27E16_1007#I can't be her little girl forever.
S27E16_1009#That must be really hard for you.
S27E16_1010#It is!
S27E16_1012#I'm so sorry you have to go through this.
S27E16_1013#Thank you.
S27E16_1016#That listening-to-women junk
S27E16_1018#you taught me really works.
S27E16_1020#The trick is in the nodding.
S27E16_1023#Dad, after seeing Mom and Lisa go at it,
S27E16_1026#I'm glad our relationship is about physical abuse,
S27E16_1028#not psychological.
S27E16_1030#Me, too, boy.
S27E16_1033#This press conference was originally scheduled
S27E16_1035#to introduce our ten Mars mission finalists.
S27E16_1038#However, our rivals at Space Colony One,
S27E16_1040#a division of Pepperidge Farms,
S27E16_1042#just announced that their Mars rocket is nearing completion.
S27E16_1045#We made a solemn promise to Fig Glutens
S27E16_1048#that they would be the first cookie on Mars.
S27E16_1049#Therefore,
S27E16_1051#we have moved up our launch date from 2026 to...
S27E16_1054#Thursday.
S27E16_1055#Thursday?
S27E16_1056#This Thursday?
S27E16_1058#Are you all ready to be a part of history?
S27E16_1060#I wanted to be someone
S27E16_1062#who's bravely going to Mars eventually.
S27E16_1064#I haven't used my open table dining points!
S27E16_1066#I'm still very much an alcoholic.
S27E16_1071#Uh, I-I guess we should leave, too.
S27E16_1074#- I knew it! - What?
S27E16_1076#This has all been an elaborate charade.
S27E16_1078#You never had the guts to go to Mars.
S27E16_1080#Oh, I have the guts.
S27E16_1083#I once went to a rock concert by myself in the rain.
S27E16_1085#It was Loverboy.
S27E16_1087#Then let's go. To Mars.
S27E16_1089#Yeah, let's go!
S27E16_1091#To Mars.
S27E16_1094#Ladies and gentlemen,
S27E16_1096#mankind's first residents of Mars,
S27E16_1098#powered by Simmer-Time dinner sauces.
S27E16_1100#Dinner time is Simmer-Time. For sauce.
S27E16_1104#They're leaving in a week?
S27E16_1105#Mom's my only good parent.
S27E16_1107#And Lisa's my only good kid!
S27E16_1108#Why won't they admit
S27E16_1110#that neither of them actually wants to go to Mars?
S27E16_1111#I'm not giving up yet.
S27E16_1113#There's got to be a limit to their stubbornness, right?
S27E16_1116#T-minus one minute to launch.
S27E16_1123#Here we go! I guess.
S27E16_1125#Yep.
S27E16_1127#We're doing this, apparently.
S27E16_1129#I'm sorry I doubted you, mom.
S27E16_1131#There's no one I would rather go to Mars with.
S27E16_1134#I love you, sweetie.
S27E16_1135#I love you, too.
S27E16_1138#I don't want to go!
S27E16_1140#This is the stupidest idea we ever had!
S27E16_1143#Abort launch!
S27E16_1145#That's a negative.
S27E16_1147#I think you're forgetting the model of Blue Bronco
S27E16_1148#"Let's do this thing."
S27E16_1149#Twelve...
S27E16_1150#Eleven...
S27E16_1151#This is not happening.
S27E16_1153#Do you know how to run the dishwasher?
S27E16_1154#Of course not!
S27E16_1156#Maybe we can use paper plates!
S27E16_1157#Where the hell do we get those?
S27E16_1159#- Mom, no! - Marge, no!
S27E16_1160#...Three...
S27E16_1162#Two... One...
S27E16_1163#Ignition!
S27E16_1166#It's not a real rocket.
S27E16_1168#It's the outside of a real rocket.
S27E16_1170#We did plan to build a real rocket.
S27E16_1172#And that's one thing they can never take away from us.
S27E16_1174#That plan is our legacy.
S27E16_1177#Then why did you move up the launch if you knew it was fake?
S27E16_1179#To inspire the next generation.
S27E16_1181#And to provide a distraction while we drove away.
S27E16_1184#Then why are you still here?
S27E16_1185#Our car wouldn't start.
S27E16_1190#Mom, doesn't it frighten you
S27E16_1193#That we almost went to Mars out of sheer stubbornness?
S27E16_1196#That's what a mother-daughter relationship is, sweetie.
S27E16_1199#A series of near-fatal emotional standoffs.
S27E16_1202#Okay, but it doesn't have to be that way.
S27E16_1204#Surely we can learn from this.
S27E16_1205#One day, we'll figure it out.
S27E16_1207#On this planet or another.
S27E16_1215#It's my life!
S27E16_1217#If I want to leave Mars
S27E16_1219#and move to Venus, you can't stop me!
S27E16_1223#Mom's always trying to hold me back.
S27E16_1225#I know, I know.
S27E16_1227#I can't be her little girl forever.
S27E16_1229#That must be really hard for you.
S27E16_1230#It is.
S27E16_1232#Nod-bot is so sorry you have to go through this.
S27E16_1234#Thank you.
S27E16_1244#Well, that's one for the win column.
S27E16_1246#I can't wait to find out what we're gonna do next.
S27E16_1249#We should fix racism.
S27E16_1251#Racism is bad for business.
S27E16_1253#And that is racism's fatal flaw.
S27E16_1255#I'm thinking of an app
S27E16_1257#that would use the best algorithms in the world.
S27E16_1260#Algorithms like that would be great
S27E16_1262#for this idea I've been back-burnering.
S27E16_1264#It's an ad-supported restaurant.
S27E16_1266#You get free food, but you have to watch ads.
S27E16_1268#If you want a hamburger, you watch five ads.
S27E16_1270#Tater tots are, like, three ads.
S27E16_1271#Have you tried these things?
S27E16_1272#- I¡¯ve heard about them, actually. - They're good. 
S27E16_1273#- I didn't actually... - They're really good.
S27E16_1275#I love everything you just said,
S27E16_1277#but what if it was a barbershop?
S27E16_1279#Might be a good idea...
S27E16_1281#if you're interested in changing the world!
S27E17_126#I've always wanted to.
S27E17_128#The truth is, sir, I'm in love with...
S27E17_130#The sound of your own voice?
S27E17_131#Yes, well, no doubt would I,
S27E17_133#listening to the nightingale trill her unending tune.
S27E17_136#Don't take this the wrong way, but you mean nothing to me.
S27E17_138#Someone I give less thought to than the little piece
S27E17_140#of popcorn stuck in my tooth.
S27E17_141#Ooh, can you remove it?
S27E17_144#I'll see you back at the office. Don't be late.
S27E17_154#*I have lived half of my life*
S27E17_158#*Living half of a life*
S27E17_162#*Waiting for you to 34*
S27E17_169#*Can't you see the fire burning in my core*
S27E17_175#*Is there a half life for hope*
S27E17_178#*I know the answer is "Nope"*
S27E17_181#*I failed at my mission*
S27E17_184#*No fusion, just fission*
S27E17_190#*And now I'm here wishing to be decomissioned*
S27E17_195#*Have you ever felt down*
S27E17_198#*Much worse than a meltdown*
S27E17_204#*My heart is covered in Burns*
S27E17_225#Larry, Moe and Curly, get out here now!
S27E17_230#So, you like fun and games?
S27E17_232#Well, games can be fun, so, uh, that's kind of redundant.
S27E17_235#Would you like to rethink the question?
S27E17_236#Here's a game for you--
S27E17_238#Properly stack and store those rods,
S27E17_239#then perform a complete turbine
S27E17_240#maintenance procedure.
S27E17_241#Routine maintenance?
S27E17_243#We never do that.
S27E17_245#Lots of us never get to do things.
S27E17_246#Yeah, we know.
S27E17_247#We heard your song.
S27E17_254#Jacqueline Jones, reading for the part of Ilsa.
S27E17_256#Oh, I like this one.
S27E17_258#A cool girl.
S27E17_259#Plus her father owns a print shop.
S27E17_261#Free playbills.
S27E17_262#Four color.
S27E17_263#Yeah, yeah, smart. Yes.
S27E17_265#I can't fight it anymore.
S27E17_268#I ran away from you once.
S27E17_270#I can't do it again.
S27E17_272#Strange choices.
S27E17_273#Maybe that scrunchie's too tight.
S27E17_275#Well, you can teach acting.
S27E17_276#You can't teach popular.
S27E17_278#We've got our Ilsa.
S27E17_280#Are you sure? Even by school play standards,
S27E17_281#She's terrible.
S27E17_282#Skinner, I'm setting down my clipboard
S27E17_284#to signify that all future auditions
S27E17_286#are just a formality.
S27E17_288#Lisa Simpson, reading for the part of Ilsa.
S27E17_291#The egghead?
S27E17_293#Pass. Hard pass.
S27E17_294#Can I tell you a story?
S27E17_295#It's about a girl
S27E17_297#who came to Paris and met a man,
S27E17_299#a very great and courageous man.
S27E17_300#She's good.
S27E17_302#Yes, better than little miss print shop...
S27E17_304#And there you are.
S27E17_307#Guess what, you've just been promoted a grade.
S27E17_310#Everything she knew or ever became
S27E17_311#was because of him.
S27E17_313#And she looked up to him and worshipped him
S27E17_315#with a feeling she supposed was love.
S27E17_323#That's it!
S27E17_324#I'll audition for Rick.
S27E17_326#Co-stars are always fall in love.
S27E17_328#Brad and Angelina, Kermit and Miss Piggy,
S27E17_331#Mrs. Brady and Greg.
S27E17_335#The role of Ilsa goes to Lisa.
S27E17_337#Yes!
S27E17_339#The role I was anagrammed to play.
S27E17_341#And since only one child
S27E17_343#auditioned for the lead role...
S27E17_345#I am proud to announce Rick will be played by...
S27E17_349#I'm looking for a down-on-his-luck heel named Skinner.
S27E17_356#Who are you?
S27E17_358#Name's Jack Deforest,
S27E17_359#and of all the schools in all the districts,
S27E17_361#I had to get transferred to this one.
S27E17_365#You've got the part.
S27E17_367#Well, that fills out the cast.
S27E17_369#Milhouse, you're the understudy.
S27E17_370#Understudy?
S27E17_372#Both those words are horrible.
S27E17_378#Hey guys, my, uh, head's a little wet
S27E17_379#from the decontamination shower.
S27E17_383#- Thanks. - De nada.
S27E17_387#Let's see how that thing's working.
S27E17_394#Not again!
S27E17_399#Bring it back, get it working,
S27E17_402#screw it on tight.
S27E17_403#Both screws?
S27E17_404#Yes.
S27E17_406#He's chewing our ass 'cause he's unhappy.
S27E17_407#What are we gonna do here?
S27E17_408#I know the answer.
S27E17_410#We have got to get that guy a woman.
S27E17_413#A woman who can find him a man.
S27E17_419#Okay, guys, to get Smithers off our backs,
S27E17_422#I'm gonna find him a boyfriend on this.
S27E17_425#Homer, I'm a long-haul trucker,
S27E17_427#who's home-straight and highway-gay,
S27E17_430#but, uh, how do you know about grinder?
S27E17_431#My wife put me on to it.
S27E17_433#I was looking for an app for pepper grinders,
S27E17_435#and I found this.
S27E17_437#Uh, doesn't Smithers dig Burns?
S27E17_439#Yeah, but Burns doesn't want Smithers.
S27E17_442#Isn't it sad, Marge, when somebody really,
S27E17_445#really, really, really wants somebody,
S27E17_448#and they're sitting across the bar from you married to Homer?
S27E17_451#Moe, this is why I don't come here much.
S27E17_453#Oh, yeah, you're right, Marge.
S27E17_454#Hey, uh, I'm sorry.
S27E17_459#Oh, yeah.
S27E17_462#Can we just find a boyfriend for Smithers?
S27E17_465#Finally, a use for the internet.
S27E17_468#No.
S27E17_469#No.
S27E17_470#Too smoldering.
S27E17_471#Too lumberjack.
S27E17_472#Too "Look how fun I am."
S27E17_474#George Takei?
S27E17_477#Click me and we will boldly go to yogurtland,
S27E17_480#I don't care for people who cling on.
S27E17_485#Hey, why am I on this?
S27E17_487#Well, only one way to find out.
S27E17_488#Swipe.
S27E17_490#Maybe we should just invite them all to a party
S27E17_493#and see who Mr. Smithers likes.
S27E17_495#Good idea.
S27E17_498#Did somebody here swipe me?
S27E17_499#Here's five bucks.
S27E17_500#Visit my Dad. Say you're me.
S27E17_502#Finally, I'm paid to act.
S27E17_505#Tell you what,
S27E17_507#if you buy a half-page ad in the program,
S27E17_510#Sam plays "As time goes by" with hulk hands.
S27E17_513#You have a deal.
S27E17_517#I'm glad someone's getting something from this play.
S27E17_521#As an understudy, all I get is to watch
S27E17_523#Lisa and Jack fall in love.
S27E17_526#Oh, you're still here.
S27E17_530#Look, Milhouse, if anything happens
S27E17_533#to that kid playing Rick...
S27E17_534#You get the part.
S27E17_536#If you catch my drift.
S27E17_538#You know I can't catch.
S27E17_541#Don't judge me.
S27E17_545#Jack, you're amazing.
S27E17_547#You're blowing away everyone else in the play.
S27E17_551#You despise me, don't you?
S27E17_554#If I gave you any thought,
S27E17_556#I probably would.
S27E17_558#I'll be in my trailer.
S27E17_562#This isn't Fiji water.
S27E17_564#Yo, dingus, someone doesn't want you in that play.
S27E17_567#Who let you three gorillas out of the zoo?
S27E17_570#Gorillas.
S27E17_572#It's not funny.
S27E17_575#How'd you get the bullies
S27E17_576#to take out Jack?
S27E17_578#The most powerful bribe in the world
S27E17_580#a free full-page ad in the play program.
S27E17_584#It's a funny thing about fists, everyone gets them,
S27E17_587#but not everyone gets the instruction manual.
S27E17_589#Oh, no,
S27E17_591#his mouth wrote checks, his fists could cash!
S27E17_597#Someone is using the go-round
S27E17_598#For non-merry purposes.
S27E17_599#Attention.
S27E17_601#In Casablanca, the part of Rick Blaine
S27E17_603#will now be played by Milhouse.
S27E17_605#Also, the cafeteria is out of buns,
S27E17_607#so for hamburgers we will now be using
S27E17_609#two slices of day-old toast.
S27E17_610#That is all.
S27E17_616#"Where you're going, I can't..."
S27E17_618#Line!
S27E17_619#"Follow!"
S27E17_621#Sounds weird to me.
S27E17_622#"I can't follow."
S27E17_624#"I can't follow."
S27E17_625#Also,
S27E17_627#why would Nazis respect letters of transit signed by De Gaulle?
S27E17_630#I may be pulling on a thread, but hear me out...
S27E17_637#Everything looks great, Marge.
S27E17_639#That cheese is cubed perfectly.
S27E17_640#Thank you.
S27E17_642#I get queasy when I see cubes that are cut on the bias.
S27E17_646#Oh, Mr. Smithers.
S27E17_648#Come in, come in, come in.
S27E17_650#Can I get you a Tom Collins?
S27E17_652#Hello, Tom Collins.
S27E17_655#Hmm, I see what's going on here.
S27E17_656#Fix up your boss,
S27E17_658#so he won't be so hard on you.
S27E17_660#Well, nice try.
S27E17_662#I want a vodka tonic, and then I'm gonna leave.
S27E17_665#Mr. Collins,
S27E17_668#would you be charmed by horror stories of working with Bill Shatner?
S27E17_670#Uh, who?
S27E17_671#I like you already.
S27E17_672#You know what?
S27E17_674#I don't think that attitude is the real you.
S27E17_677#I believe you have a pinched nerve in your neck,
S27E17_679#And guess what?
S27E17_681#You're in luck, because I give great massage.
S27E17_684#Sorry, not interested.
S27E17_687#How did you do that?
S27E17_689#Would you like to discuss that
S27E17_691#over peruvian tapas?
S27E17_693#Simpson, I'm stealing your bartender.
S27E17_694#Take the next couple days off.
S27E17_696#Three day bender!
S27E17_701#Are there any gay-themed songs about celebrating?
S27E17_710#Did you used to jog with Monty?
S27E17_712#Mm, sort of.
S27E17_731#Smithers, where have you been?
S27E17_732#I'm dictating my autobiography.
S27E17_734#Chapter one, a commotion at the telegraph office.
S27E17_737#I'm afraid I have other plans.
S27E17_738#There are no other plans.
S27E17_740#Now take my picture for the back cover.
S27E17_743#No, sir, I don't think I will.
S27E17_745#In fact, what I'm going to do is...
S27E17_747#Quit!
S27E17_750#My god, I did it.
S27E17_751#I actually quit.
S27E17_753#No one quits me.
S27E17_760#One more button.
S27E17_763#You're forgetting who installed this system.
S27E17_767#Ahoy-hoy!
S27E17_770#So, you want time off for your sister's funeral?
S27E17_773#Miss Naegle,
S27E17_775#release the hounds.
S27E17_776#Wh-what do you mean?
S27E17_778#Send vicious dogs to rip him to shreds.
S27E17_780#But wouldn't I be criminally liable?
S27E17_782#I said release!
S27E17_783#Release, release!
S27E17_785#That sounds vaguely sexual.
S27E17_787#I'm gonna have to file a grievance.
S27E17_789#Also, let's just see how you've been treating those hounds.
S27E17_791#What the...
S27E17_793#Okay, we're gonna have to shut this all down.
S27E17_796#You know, he doesn't give me health insurance...
S27E17_798#And I, uh, I think I have rabies.
S27E17_800#Okay, that's it, Mr. Burns.
S27E17_801#I'm gonna need to speak
S27E17_803#to your Head of Human Resources.
S27E17_804#It's this guy.
S27E17_812#What are you doing?
S27E17_814#Sorry. I used to do that for Mr. Burns.
S27E17_816#Ah, forget about Burns.
S27E17_818#Ancient-a history.
S27E17_820#I left-a the Italy 40 years ago,
S27E17_822#but do you see me-a crying
S27E17_825#in my pappardelle rustiche con salsiccia e porri?
S27E17_828#Waylon, just what did you see in him?
S27E17_836#Now to set her down gently on the golf course.
S27E17_844#You're right, totally.
S27E17_845#I'm here for you.
S27E17_847#Listen, I'm making a trip to Cuba, okay?
S27E17_850#My homeland, where my accent
S27E17_852#is not so rediculous.
S27E17_854#Come with me to Havana.
S27E17_859#W-wait a minute.
S27E17_861#I'm... not sure.
S27E17_863#But this is the route we're gonna take.
S27E17_864#Oh, what the hell,
S27E17_865#this is gonna be the time of my life.
S27E17_866#I'm in!
S27E17_871#Milhouse is the worst actor I've ever seen,
S27E17_874#and I have to play opposite him!
S27E17_877#He's so bad.
S27E17_879#Look at his headshot.
S27E17_883#Whenever I'm dealing with someone 
S27E17_884#who isn't doing a great job,
S27E17_887#what I do is treat them like they're perfect.
S27E17_889#Really?
S27E17_891#If they sense you believe in them,
S27E17_892#they'll get better.
S27E17_893#Did our taxes, Marge.
S27E17_895#The government owes us $2 million.
S27E17_898#That is really, really great,
S27E17_900#but maybe you should check again.
S27E17_901#What?
S27E17_902#Oh, I... My mistake.
S27E17_904#We owe them $37.
S27E17_906#That's some nice adding.
S27E17_907#Yeah.
S27E17_916#I've done it.
S27E17_917#I'm happy.
S27E17_918#I'm in a new world
S27E17_920#and completely forgotten about...
S27E17_922#What, the Buzzard of Death?
S27E17_925#It reminds you of him!
S27E17_926#I'm sorry, sir.
S27E17_928#You address me like I am him.
S27E17_931#Everything reminds you of him!
S27E17_932#I bet that mural of him
S27E17_934#being driven out of Cuba in 1959
S27E17_937#reminds you of him!
S27E17_940#Waylon, I am a man who needs 100% commitment, okay?
S27E17_945#Okay, well, maybe not 100,
S27E17_947#but at least, like, 20, you know, 
S27E17_949#which is the percentage that your cell phone needs
S27E17_951#to stay in the green.
S27E17_953#So tell me now, Waylon.
S27E17_955#Am I in the green?
S27E17_957#I'm afraid not.
S27E17_962#Beneath this mask I am crying.
S27E17_965#Everyone who's replaced Smithers
S27E17_966#has been nothing but trouble.
S27E17_968#You're my lawyers, tell me what to do.
S27E17_970#Sir, I think your only option is to get Mr. Smithers back.
S27E17_973#You'll have to give him money.
S27E17_975#Lots of money, but it won't be enough.
S27E17_976#- Yes. ... - Absolutely.
S27E17_978#Yes, I suppose what this calls for
S27E17_981#is a personal apology straight from my heart.
S27E17_984#Have it on my desk first thing tomorrow...
S27E17_987#And write yourselves apologies from me to you
S27E17_989#for making you work late,
S27E17_991#and they'd better sound sincere.
S27E17_1002#You're going to be great.
S27E17_1003#I already am...
S27E17_1005#Because you just told me so.
S27E17_1009#Thank you.
S27E17_1012#So, what brought you to Casablanca?
S27E17_1015#I came here for the waters.
S27E17_1018#There are no waters in Casablanca.
S27E17_1021#I was misinformed.
S27E17_1024#Is it just me or is Milhouse really killing it?
S27E17_1027#He's like a young Noah Wylie.
S27E17_1032#If that plane leaves the ground
S27E17_1034#And you're not with him, you'll regret it.
S27E17_1036#Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
S27E17_1039#but soon and for the rest of your life.
S27E17_1043#You did it, Marge.
S27E17_1045#This earns my highest praise
S27E17_1047#get through-able.
S27E17_1053#Milhouse, you were incredible.
S27E17_1055#Maybe that's because...
S27E17_1057#I'm not Milhouse.
S27E17_1061#Oh, but, is Milhouse okay?
S27E17_1063#Is Milhouse ever okay?
S27E17_1064#Good point.
S27E17_1066#Now let's go to the soda fountain
S27E17_1068#and ask the jerk for a float with two straws.
S27E17_1070#What year are you from?
S27E17_1073#Oh, who cares?
S27E17_1076#Mr. Burns, Mr. Smithers,
S27E17_1080#I make-a something very special for your reunion.
S27E17_1082#One cheese pizza.
S27E17_1083#Well, Smithers, I got here
S27E17_1084#as soon as I heard you wanted to meet.
S27E17_1086#Took something called Uber, 
S27E17_1088#which I thought would be a Wehrmacht staff car, 
S27E17_1090#but turned out to be a...
S27E17_1092#Prius, driven by a...
S27E17_1093#woman.
S27E17_1094#Now, down to business.
S27E17_1097#It's all here.
S27E17_1098#Everything it'll take to get him back.
S27E17_1100#Oh, no, forgot the starbucks card.
S27E17_1101#Is it too late to...
S27E17_1102#Sir, before you start,
S27E17_1104#Let me say I don't want money,
S27E17_1106#and I don't want some letter written by your lawyers.
S27E17_1108#I want to know why you want me back.
S27E17_1111#I see.
S27E17_1113#Well, the thing is,
S27E17_1115#You really care about me, don't you?
S27E17_1117#Maybe a little, still.
S27E17_1118#All right, Smithers.
S27E17_1120#There's one thing I've never given you.
S27E17_1122#I kept it bottled up inside all these years
S27E17_1124#and here it is...
S27E17_1126#Your performance review.
S27E17_1128#It's... Excellent.
S27E17_1131#Amazingly, that's enough.
S27E17_1132#Thank you, sir.
S27E17_1139#No music!
S27E17_1145#I heard you serve 10-year-olds.
S27E17_1147#That's referring to the age of the pickled eggs,
S27E17_1149#but, uh, I'll get you a milk.
S27E17_1153#Mr. Smithers, why do guys do such stupid things 
S27E17_1155#when it comes to dames?
S27E17_1157#Hey, you been talking to that weird bogart kid?
S27E17_1159#He came around here trying to talk me
S27E17_1161#into an expedition to find some gold.
S27E17_1164#Yeah, so I'm getting the mules.
S27E17_1167#Let me tell you about dames, milhouse.
S27E17_1169#I know nothing about them, but as for love,
S27E17_1171#what keeps you going is the thrill of the chase.
S27E17_1173#The possibility that one day you Might get what you want, 
S27E17_1175#even though the reality is you probably never will.
S27E17_1178#That's why I don't chase dames.
S27E17_1180#Just gold.
S27E17_1181#I'll be back in six months
S27E17_1183#With one-third of the biggest treasure you ever saw.
S27E18_130#At least it wasn't a total waste.
S27E18_131#I found a quarter.
S27E18_136#Well, we sure got him good.
S27E18_138#Duh, what a moron, duh.
S27E18_141#I sure wish Archie was alive to see it.
S27E18_154#It's Thursday night, and that can only mean,
S27E18_156#counter-intuitively, football!
S27E18_158#From London's Wembley Stadium,
S27E18_160#the Jacksonville Jag-u-ars and Tampa Bay "Bucs"
S27E18_163#vie for Florida bragging rights.
S27E18_165#Does not include Miami.
S27E18_168#*When you're not happy*
S27E18_170#*Watching your Downton Abbey*
S27E18_172#*You can always see*
S27E18_175#*Football*
S27E18_176#*Not British Football*
S27E18_178#*But American Football*
S27E18_180#*Which has higher scores*
S27E18_183#*Touchdown*
S27E18_188#If these U.K. Clich¨¦s are any indication,
S27E18_190#we are in for one gobsmacking match.
S27E18_194#To see or not to see. That is no question.
S27E18_197#Dad, I'm worried.
S27E18_199#No one is falling for my pranks anymore.
S27E18_200#Son,
S27E18_202#I know this seems like the biggest disappointment of your life,
S27E18_206#but trust me, there are going to be so many more.
S27E18_208#What you've got to remember is-- 
S27E18_210#oh, my God, 13 men in the field!
S27E18_212#Review it, review it, review it.
S27E18_214#Yes! Play stands!
S27E18_217#Here comes the airplane!
S27E18_220#Thanks to your late football-watching,
S27E18_222#you missed breakfast.
S27E18_224#Eh, don't worry, Marge, I'll make my own.
S27E18_242#Mom, I've been working on a new solo jazz piece.
S27E18_245#Can I hear it?
S27E18_249#Oh, I'd love to stay and listen, but I'm late for work.
S27E18_255#Here's another super-fan to hear you lay down your licks.
S27E18_267#Brava. 
S27E18_269#I knew you'd like it.
S27E18_276#Hey, I am too young to be over the hill.
S27E18_278#Lucky for me, there's a Ralph born every minute.
S27E18_281#Hey, Ralph, how about a napkin?
S27E18_283#Do I look stupid?
S27E18_288#Wall licorice.
S27E18_297#Marge, nothing says "I'm sorry" better than flowers.
S27E18_300#Except for fundamental behavioral change,
S27E18_302#but you can't buy that at the supermarket.
S27E18_304#They do smell nice.
S27E18_306#Hey, Dad, want to hear my solo?
S27E18_308#I added a few variations today.
S27E18_309#Of course I would.
S27E18_311#Okay. Aw, my reed is split.
S27E18_313#I'll be right back.
S27E18_316#I've already heard Lisa's song once.
S27E18_318#I've had a long day, and to be completely honest,
S27E18_322#I really can't stand jazz.
S27E18_330#What about when Lisa plays it?
S27E18_332#All the same.
S27E18_337#Sounds great, honey.
S27E18_342#So, you really don't like jazz?
S27E18_344#I never realized we have so much in common.
S27E18_346#And scat-singing.
S27E18_350#Do I give a darn?
S27E18_352#So, all these years, you've been lying to me?
S27E18_357#So, let's get it all out here.
S27E18_359#Mom, you were only pretending to like it this morning
S27E18_361#when I played My Funny Valentine.
S27E18_363#That was My Funny Valentine? Hoo-boy.
S27E18_366#Wouldn't expect you to get it.
S27E18_368#So busy juggling three children,
S27E18_370#you don't even notice when one is hanging by a thread,
S27E18_373#a thread you just cut forever!
S27E18_376#Lisa, this a family.
S27E18_378#You do not take that tone with another family member.
S27E18_380#You tell 'em, butterbean.
S27E18_381#Shut up, idiot.
S27E18_383#Lisa, honey, you're hurt, 
S27E18_385#but hurting me back is not going to feel as good as you think.
S27E18_389#Just know that I am very, very sorry.
S27E18_400#Good night, Marjorie.
S27E18_403#Marjorie.
S27E18_405#She called me "Mar-jo-rie."
S27E18_407#So? Bart calls me Homer.
S27E18_409#You know that's out of disrespect.
S27E18_410#Dis-respect?
S27E18_412#- Is that a word? - Yes.
S27E18_414#And there's this guy at work that calls me Hoss.
S27E18_415#What's that all about?
S27E18_416#This is awful.
S27E18_418#Lisa and I have always been so close.
S27E18_423#Now, for your first day at school,
S27E18_425#you get what my mother gave me.
S27E18_427#Pearls?
S27E18_428#Just like Mommy's.
S27E18_435#Dad, is there anything you pass along?
S27E18_437#Predilection for kidney stones.
S27E18_442#What if Lisa doesn't want to be friends with me anymore?
S27E18_445#Marge, it's not your job to be friends with your kids,
S27E18_448#it's my job. Good night, sweetie.
S27E18_450#Oh, uh, Bart and I
S27E18_452#are gonna see an R-rated movie Saturday.
S27E18_455#It has boobs, but they're elf boobs.
S27E18_456#Is that cool?
S27E18_458#Hmm. I guess.
S27E18_465#So long, whoopee cushion.
S27E18_475#Ah, good old peanut brittle.
S27E18_476#What the...?
S27E18_478#A coiled wire spring covered by a snake-patterned vinyl sheath?
S27E18_492#Lisa, our weekend in Capital City will make us friends again.
S27E18_496#I don't see your saxophone.
S27E18_497#That must be a relief to you.
S27E18_499#Honey, I want you to bring it.
S27E18_502#Sure, should I grab some Kenny G CDs too?
S27E18_504#Some Chuck Mangione?
S27E18_506#That would be lovely!
S27E18_508#Oh, I-I get it, they're popular, so you don't like them.
S27E18_510#Just please get your sax.
S27E18_514#Airport shuttle?
S27E18_517#Yes, I'm going on a trip with a special little girl.
S27E18_520#That baby is adorable.
S27E18_521#Oh, it's not the baby.
S27E18_524#Great, now I've got both daughters mad at me.
S27E18_527#May I say that you sound like a terrible mother?
S27E18_529#But no one ever cares what the shuttle bus driver thinks.
S27E18_532#"Take me to terminal four," They say.
S27E18_534#Actually, we're at terminal three.
S27E18_536#Arguing with everyone today, aren't you?
S27E18_538#Okay, we'll see you on Monday, Homer.
S27E18_545#I'm feeling really sad too, Dad.
S27E18_547#Nothing cheers people up like a baby.
S27E18_550#Boy, we each have to do our part, and I'm gonna make dinner.
S27E18_553#And I'm gonna start with...
S27E18_555#Ice cream!
S27E18_556#Come back!
S27E18_558#Don't make me jog.
S27E18_561#Why is your father chasing after the spay and neuter van?
S27E18_563#You got me.
S27E18_565#What do I do with you?
S27E18_569#Hey, this is fun.
S27E18_578#I like having a sister.
S27E18_580#Helps that you don't say anything.
S27E18_603#I wonder how you are at pranks.
S27E18_609#We're not worthy. We're not worthy.
S27E18_612#I'm back!
S27E18_614#Don't drop that angel.
S27E18_617#Hi, folks, and welcome to the Capital City Dream Tour.
S27E18_620#If you're here for the Capital City Crime Tour,
S27E18_622#that leaves in 20 minutes.
S27E18_626#Let's wave to that to that ordinary hot dog vendor.
S27E18_632#Wow, he's anything but ordinary.
S27E18_637#You know, I wouldn't be surprised
S27E18_640#if he turned up one of Capital City's Broadway-caliber shows.
S27E18_655#There's got to be something here
S27E18_657#that'll calm down little yellow pill.
S27E18_660#*Here comes Paul*
S27E18_661#*To guard the mall*
S27E18_663#*But when will he fall in love*
S27E18_668#*Hey, G.I. Jane*
S27E18_670#*Let's make it plain*
S27E18_672#*How do you train for love*
S27E18_676#*Men in black*
S27E18_678#*We'll state a fact*
S27E18_680#*The thing that you lack is love*
S27E18_683#I always like when a black guy teams up with a white guy.
S27E18_686#It gives us hope.
S27E18_688#That's the show for Lisa.
S27E18_690#She'll love it!
S27E18_692#The Bad News Bears?
S27E18_694#Is there nothing so beautiful
S27E18_696#that they won't keep exploiting till it's worthless?
S27E18_698#Well, they're expensive,
S27E18_700#which means if I die, you're still taking me.
S27E18_703#Also, I bought you a little present from a street vendor.
S27E18_705#They're earrings.
S27E18_707#He's a cool cucumber, huh?
S27E18_710#Mom, I'm really not into jewelry right now.
S27E18_713#You're not wearing your pearls.
S27E18_715#Um, the clasp wasn't working.
S27E18_716#I can fix it.
S27E18_718#There are some things that can't be fixed.
S27E18_720#What are you saying?
S27E18_722#You really don't understand
S27E18_724#how much this has hurt me.
S27E18_726#Jazz is my thing, and you said you loved my thing,
S27E18_729#but you lied.
S27E18_731#You'll have a daughter someday, too.
S27E18_733#And when she yells at you like that...
S27E18_735#she'll be right.
S27E18_740#Oh, who can sit with their back turned
S27E18_742#as their mother is crying?
S27E18_747#A jazz musician, that's who.
S27E18_750#Well, you guys understand.
S27E18_752#Don't look at me, I'm a pity present.
S27E18_754#I'm just glad I'm not in a salad.
S27E18_761#Oh grande Papa, es muy glamouroso.
S27E18_764#Solo lo mejor para my princesa.
S27E18_771#Why didn't I get in the quincea?era game years ago?
S27E18_773#Uh, excuse me, sir,
S27E18_775#I have three sisters turning 15.
S27E18_778#Oh boy.
S27E18_779#Can you hold baby Maggie here,
S27E18_781#while I check out las tiaras para la quincea?era?
S27E18_784#Oh, a cute little rugrat like that? You betcha.
S27E18_787#Hey, look at ol' Gil holding a baby.
S27E18_789#I'm not even dropping it.
S27E18_791#Oh! Why did I say that?
S27E18_793#Now it's all I can think about.
S27E18_796#Oh, every time I get a great job, I drop a baby.
S27E18_805#If I can just get her to share an armrest,
S27E18_807#that would be a start.
S27E18_813#*A ragtag bunch of misfits*
S27E18_816#*And a no-goodnik rub-a-dub*
S27E18_819#*How can I make them winners*
S27E18_822#*In baseball*
S27E18_824#*And at love*
S27E18_829#*Corey Leak is a hip-shakin', rule-breakin' bad boy*
S27E18_832#I'm a bad boy.
S27E18_836#*But I've got a crush on Amanda, so*

S27E18_854#Here comes the tying run.
S27E18_856#Tie, Corey, tie.
S27E18_857#You're out!
S27E18_860#*To you, I'm out*
S27E18_864#*But to me, I'm home*
S27E18_869#*Time for the*
S27E18_872#*Show stopper*
S27E18_878#*The big cork popper*
S27E18_882#Lisa, you're gonna have to admit it,
S27E18_884#your mom has the bad taste of...
S27E18_886#well, a mom.
S27E18_888#I'm gonna have to mother myself.
S27E18_890#You quit complaining, and pretend you like it.
S27E18_896#I knew she'd come around.
S27E18_898#What's all this nonsense?
S27E18_903#Quit clapping, I've got a hangover.
S27E18_905#*We'll win the game*
S27E18_908#*Of love*
S27E18_913#Exit to your left.
S27E18_916#That's too tight, Bill.
S27E18_929#Wonderful.
S27E18_931#Did it do it for you too?
S27E18_932#Not yet.
S27E18_934#Stand back. I said stand back.
S27E18_936#Who are you?
S27E18_943#Oh, you were our star tonight.
S27E18_946#That's a performance I'll never forget.
S27E18_949#So what are you sophisticated ladies up to next?
S27E18_951#Well, I thought we might have an after show nosh
S27E18_952#at the Penny Loafer.
S27E18_954#Invitation noted and accepted.
S27E18_956#Well, good,
S27E18_958#because getting a table for three is so much easier.
S27E18_964#Hey! You're not Nathan Lane!
S27E18_972#Here he comes.
S27E18_974#Aw, don't worry, Bart Jr.,
S27E18_976#Daddy will get that for you.
S27E18_982#Why you little...
S27E18_985#Dad, no! You're gonna strangle a baby!
S27E18_987#Oh my God.
S27E18_988#That would've been horrible.
S27E18_990#Why you little...
S27E18_991#Turning...
S27E18_992#a sweet little baby...
S27E18_994#into a you!
S27E18_997#Bart, you're a great kid,
S27E18_998#but if I had another one like you,
S27E18_1000#I'd hang myself from a highway overpass.
S27E18_1003#Please, give your sister the precious gift
S27E18_1006#of not being you.
S27E18_1007#Okay, dad.
S27E18_1009#Mags, it was fun while it lasted.
S27E18_1014#I didn't know it was that easy.
S27E18_1016#Stop that!
S27E18_1019#Sideshow Bob!
S27E18_1024#So, Lisa, think we'll see any stars?
S27E18_1027#Mom, it's a tourist trap.
S27E18_1029#Celebrities don't actually come in here.
S27E18_1031#Until today, right?
S27E18_1032#Well, you never know.
S27E18_1034#I'll ask the hostess if anyone's expected.
S27E18_1037#Aw, she keeps doing this.
S27E18_1038#I'm sorry, what?
S27E18_1040#Every time she tries to fix things between us,
S27E18_1042#it just emphasizes how different we are.
S27E18_1044#For what it's worth, my mom loved your show tonight.
S27E18_1047#She pretty much sees the best in everything.
S27E18_1048#Amazing, really,
S27E18_1050#considering she has a husband who randomly shows up to work,
S27E18_1053#a son who, god bless him, is probably heading for the chair.
S27E18_1056#And an ungrateful little girl
S27E18_1058#who ignores her mother's frantic attempts at reconciliation,
S27E18_1060#and tells family secrets to a total stranger.
S27E18_1063#A total stranger The New York Times calls
S27E18_1065#"A charming presence."
S27E18_1066#You don't know me at all!
S27E18_1069#But hardly anybody likes jazz.
S27E18_1072#Why should I expect my mom to?
S27E18_1074#That's right, you have to see the other side.
S27E18_1076#The one that always makes you wrong.
S27E18_1078#Mom.
S27E18_1080#Mom, I can't stay mad at you.
S27E18_1082#I'm putting my pearls back on.
S27E18_1085#Oh, thank you, sweetie.
S27E18_1087#And I apologize for expressing my sincere feelings.
S27E18_1098#Why don't you show us what you got, Lisa?
S27E18_1100#That's right, I learned your name.
S27E18_1103#It's not all about me, Andrew Rannells.
S27E18_1106#20 bucks for ten minutes with the sax.
S27E18_1115#Hey, that little turd can play.
S27E18_1117#I'm just getting warmed up.
S27E18_1122#*Don't tell me not live*
S27E18_1123#*Just sit and putter*
S27E18_1125#*Life's candy and the sun's*
S27E18_1126#*A ball of butter*
S27E18_1128#*Don't bring around a cloud*
S27E18_1131#*To rain on my parade*
S27E18_1133#My parade.
S27E18_1135#Sorry.
S27E18_1137#*Don't tell me not to fly*
S27E18_1138#*I simply got to*
S27E18_1140#*If someone takes a spill, it's me, and not you*
S27E18_1145#*Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade*
S27E18_1148#*Get ready for me, Love*
S27E18_1150#*Cause I'm a "Comer"*
S27E18_1151#*I simply got to march*
S27E18_1152#*My heart's a drummer*
S27E18_1154#*Nobody, no*
S27E18_1155#*Nobody*
S27E18_1157#*Is gonna rain on*
S27E18_1161#*My parade*
S27E18_1170#Well, what do you think?
S27E18_1172#My golden girl.
S27E18_1177#Straight ahead is the the 19th Street Liquor Store,
S27E18_1180#the epicenter of the 1967 riots,
S27E18_1183#which never fully stopped.
S27E18_1186#Ahead is the high rise
S27E18_1188#where State Senator Wilcox was shot in mid-air,
S27E18_1191#as he plummeted to his death.
S27E18_1196#Best trip of my life.
S27E19_172#instead of butter for shortbread cookies.
S27E19_176#Which is, apparently, flakier,
S27E19_179#but at what cost?
S27E19_181#And she...
S27E19_188#Wh...? Huh?
S27E19_189#What the... ?
S27E19_191#Okay, sweetie, I got a story
S27E19_193#about another little girl who got lost in the woods,
S27E19_195#but it wasn't a girl,
S27E19_197#and it wasn't the woods.
S27E19_200#Suck, suck, indeed.
S27E19_202#And it all happened once upon a time,
S27E19_203#before you were born,
S27E19_205#and my chances for a man cave
S27E19_206#went out the window.
S27E19_216#Bless you all for sacrificing your Saturday afternoon
S27E19_219#to help us clean up skid row.
S27E19_222#When God came for Sunday, I said nothing.
S27E19_225#Now he comes for Saturday.
S27E19_227#Homer Simpson, it's one thing to moan and groan on the bus,
S27E19_229#but in front of these unfortunates,
S27E19_231#well, that just curls my 'stache.
S27E19_236#Hey, Flanders, why don't you take some advice
S27E19_237#from your Bible and zip it?
S27E19_239#Oh, where does the Bible say zip it?
S27E19_241#It's the first thing the burning bush said to Moses.
S27E19_244#Thank you for teaching us Scripture.
S27E19_246#Thank you.
S27E19_252#You know, all this helping others
S27E19_254#is giving me the most satisfying feeling ever.
S27E19_257#So satisfying.
S27E19_259#Uh, Lenny...
S27E19_263#I get why they do it. Totally get it.
S27E19_268#Hey, Carl, you want to buy all my stuff for five dollars?
S27E19_273#Well, thank you all for spending the day
S27E19_276#thinking of others instead of yourselves.
S27E19_279#Saturday. It was a Saturday.
S27E19_281#Now, a reward to the most selfless cleaner:
S27E19_284#A family vacation to the Grand Canyon.
S27E19_287#The winner: Ned Flanders.
S27E19_289#Surprise, surprise.
S27E19_291#The guy that did the best job wins.
S27E19_296#But this gift certificate is for two families.
S27E19_298#Hey, Reverend, we'd love it if you and Helen would join us.
S27E19_304#Of course we'd love to join you,
S27E19_306#but I've noticed that you and Homer
S27E19_308#haven't been the friendliest "Neighboreenos,"
S27E19_310#if you get my diddly.
S27E19_313#Uh, well, Ned, I think the Lord would want you
S27E19_316#to take the Simpsons on this trip.
S27E19_317#Our Lord?
S27E19_319#Yes. Our Lord.
S27E19_321#For would it not indeed be glorious,
S27E19_323#if in visiting a natural chasm,
S27E19_326#two quarrelsome neighbors would bridge the chasm
S27E19_329#of their own discord.
S27E19_331#Well, I guess if Job could accept his burdens.
S27E19_334#Uh, in America,
S27E19_336#it's pronounced "Job," Flanders.
S27E19_338#We can settle it when we're zipped up
S27E19_339#together in a sleeping bag.
S27E19_341#Welcome aboard.
S27E19_343#Oh, oh, we'd love to go,
S27E19_346#but is it such a good idea to travel with another family?
S27E19_349#It's fun. We travel with the Hibberts all the time.
S27E19_352#We ran into you once, in Cincinnati.
S27E19_354#And we had dinner.
S27E19_355#We slid our tables together.
S27E19_358#We were in a booth we could not get out of.
S27E19_363#Homie, we should go.
S27E19_365#You and Ned need to learn to get along.
S27E19_368#You said the same thing about me and Bart.
S27E19_371#No. The judge said the same thing about you and Bart.
S27E19_374#Judges. If they were any good they'd be lawyers.
S27E19_375#Okay, we'll go.
S27E19_377#But if Flanders gets so annoying
S27E19_378#that I can't take it anymore,
S27E19_380#the code word is octopus.
S27E19_382#Can it be something else?
S27E19_384#I don't like things with hidden beaks.
S27E19_386#Octopus or nothing.
S27E19_388#Okay.
S27E19_390#So we took eight-year-old Bart,
S27E19_392#and six-year-old Lisa.
S27E19_394#After ten hours of driving,
S27E19_397#I finally saw the most glorious site.
S27E19_437#It's like Disneyland for thin people.
S27E19_440#Did you know that the Grand Canyon was created by erosion?
S27E19_443#And before 1871, it was called Big Canyon?
S27E19_445#Okay, that's it.
S27E19_446#We're on vacation.
S27E19_448#Why, you little...
S27E19_463#Keep 'em coming, boy.
S27E19_466#That one stung me.
S27E19_469#That's enough.
S27E19_473#We're here to enjoy ourselves.
S27E19_475#If you just turn your head slightly,
S27E19_477#I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
S27E19_480#- No time. - Homer.
S27E19_488#And they say we're running out of room for our garbage.
S27E19_493#*Go tell it on the mountain*
S27E19_496#*Over the hills and everywhere*
S27E19_499#*Go tell it on the mountain*
S27E19_503#*That Jesus Christ is born*
S27E19_506#*Born, born, born, born*
S27E19_508#*Go tell it on the mountain*
S27E19_511#Octopus. Octopus.
S27E19_512#Oct-ar-pus.
S27E19_514#A vacation with Flanders?
S27E19_516#That's like telling you a bedtime story without a beer.
S27E19_524#Now, where were we?
S27E19_530#Thank you, ma'am. 
S27E19_533#Thank you. 
S27E19_540#Am I such a terrible mother
S27E19_541#that my son doesn't even know
S27E19_543#to say thank you to a waitress?
S27E19_545#Come on, honey. What do you say?
S27E19_548#You want me to lie and say I'm thankful for chicken and veg
S27E19_550#when I wanted whiskey- battered bourbon bangers?
S27E19_553#Just say thank you.
S27E19_555#My boy never said thank you.
S27E19_557#Now he's on death row.
S27E19_560#Was on death row.
S27E19_571#Daddy, when will the noise stop?
S27E19_574#Hmm. Take these.
S27E19_578#Ugh. Those were earplugs.
S27E19_588#I never thought there'd be something 
S27E19_590#I'd want to stare at longer than that car wreck on the way here.
S27E19_593#We've got to hurry before they run out of mules.
S27E19_596#Ooh. Is that what they're serving for breakfast?
S27E19_599#How about donkeys?
S27E19_600#No.
S27E19_606#That's odd.
S27E19_609#Enjoying your moon view, Homer?
S27E19_610#Why you little...
S27E19_612#Two can play at that game.
S27E19_620#Stupid kid.
S27E19_621#So embarrassing.
S27E19_624#I'm a little nervous
S27E19_626#with all these waivers we have to sign.
S27E19_628#Marge, this is a national park.
S27E19_630#People are completely safe here.
S27E19_640#Now let's do my favorite thing:
S27E19_642#go downhill.
S27E19_644#Whoa. You're 180?
S27E19_646#My blood pressure is.
S27E19_648#Okay. Uh, let's get you a mule, dude.
S27E19_656#Get me El Gordo.
S27E19_659#Gordo here used to carry 200-pound granite blocks
S27E19_661#up from the canyon.
S27E19_673#This has got to be the most beautiful thing
S27E19_676#we've ever stole from the Indians.
S27E19_682#What is that?
S27E19_683#A billionaires' retreat.
S27E19_685#Yeah, the heads of America's most powerful media companies
S27E19_688#have come to enjoy nature.
S27E19_691#Put up the cell phone tower.
S27E19_694#I said I wanted a Tom Cruise type,
S27E19_696#not Tom Cruise.
S27E19_698#Burn down the cell phone tower.
S27E19_702#I can't stand rich people.
S27E19_706#Can I name my mule?
S27E19_707#We prefer you don't.
S27E19_709#Is there a name for this trail?
S27E19_710#I'm sure there is.
S27E19_711#Is this a fun job?
S27E19_712#Not at the moment.
S27E19_713#Do you count as a grownup?
S27E19_714#My parents don't think so.
S27E19_716#You're a grownup to me.
S27E19_717#Thanks.
S27E19_718#Here, have a piece of the canyon.
S27E19_720#Are you sure it's okay?
S27E19_722#Hey, it only makes the canyon grander.
S27E19_728#I don't know where your son gets it, Marge.
S27E19_730#I'm only going to say this once,
S27E19_732#but I think you're a little checked out.
S27E19_733#Checked out. Checked out.
S27E19_735#Checked out. Checked out. Checked out.
S27E19_737#Checked out. Checked out.
S27E19_738#Checked out.
S27E19_740#Well, your kids aren't exactly perfect.
S27E19_743#Yay! We can improve.
S27E19_745#Let's think about it quietly.
S27E19_752#Boy, I bet that mustache smells really bad, huh?
S27E19_755#Oh, don't you rip on my lip strip.
S27E19_758#I smell candles and-and pew polish.
S27E19_760#We're near a church.
S27E19_763#Catholic, if I don't miss my guess.
S27E19_771#A little Popish for my taste,
S27E19_773#but I did come here for adventure.
S27E19_774#Geez, Flanders,
S27E19_775#you find God in everything.
S27E19_777#God is in everything.
S27E19_778#He's omnipresent.
S27E19_780#You mean, if I check into the Omni Hotel right now,
S27E19_782#he's there?
S27E19_783#As a matter of fact, he is.
S27E19_785#Then, from now on, we're staying at the Hyatt Regency.
S27E19_787#You're banned there, Dad.
S27E19_789#Not as Hagwar Swanson.
S27E19_792#I love this country.
S27E19_797#Are you sure this is safe?
S27E19_799#Totally. You're with State Farm, right?
S27E19_803#Where's our guide?
S27E19_804#Where's the trail?
S27E19_816#Big Maggie.
S27E19_817#I'd like to hear the rest.
S27E19_819#I still have my piece of the canyon.
S27E19_825#Okay. It was looking rough...
S27E19_829#Oh, no bars.
S27E19_831#You mean, on your phone?
S27E19_832#Hey, you're right.
S27E19_834#Oh, more bad news.
S27E19_836#Oh, most of the food was on the guide's mule.
S27E19_839#I sure am glad somebody
S27E19_841#packed all this whitefish salad.
S27E19_843#I'm willing to eat some.
S27E19_845#And if I die, you know it's bad.
S27E19_848#Homer, it's time for you and me to go out and get help.
S27E19_851#Please be careful, Uncle Ned.
S27E19_852#I will, Bart.
S27E19_854#Please, please be careful.
S27E19_855#Don't worry.
S27E19_857#If you don't come back, I'll be so sad.
S27E19_860#Excuse me? What about over here?
S27E19_861#Right.
S27E19_865#Please, please be careful.
S27E19_868#Please.
S27E19_870#Let's go, Flanders.
S27E19_880#Oh, no. The poor thing gets night terrors.
S27E19_882#I forgot to say "God bless the mailman."
S27E19_885#He's not awake, but he's not asleep.
S27E19_886#Do your kids get these?
S27E19_888#I will now that I know what they are.
S27E19_891#Other kids say I'm in their nightmares.
S27E19_893#I'm not your puppet, Bart. I'm not.
S27E19_900#You ever seen stars this bright, Homer?
S27E19_902#Blessed is the beauty of our Lord.
S27E19_923#Amen. Listen, Flanders.
S27E19_925#This trip has given me time to think.
S27E19_926#If I die here,
S27E19_928#you're welcome to live in my carcass for warmth.
S27E19_931#I'm not living in your carcass.
S27E19_933#Oh, come on. You make it sound like a bad thing.
S27E19_935#Look, we're saved!
S27E19_937#We just go down there, get some food and help
S27E19_939#returning to civilization.
S27E19_941#Attention, people talking.
S27E19_943#Unless you are here to dispose of our poop,
S27E19_946#we will start shooting in five minutes.
S27E19_959#How is that even camping?
S27E19_961#It's easier for a camel
S27E19_963#to pass through the eye of a needle
S27E19_965#than a rich man to get into heaven.
S27E19_967#Sometimes I just don't get it.
S27E19_969#What I'm saying is, the eye of the needle
S27E19_971#is very small, and a camel...
S27E19_972#No. I mean down there--
S27E19_974#they have everything we need to survive,
S27E19_975#but they won't share.
S27E19_977#Maybe if I look through these binoculars one more time,
S27E19_979#I'll-I'll see something better.
S27E19_985#We've got to go in and steal what we need.
S27E19_988#Well, thou shalt not steal.
S27E19_990#But if I don't steal, that's coveting.
S27E19_991#That's bad, too.
S27E19_993#Look, Flanders, we tried things your way,
S27E19_994#and it failed.
S27E19_996#Now let's try mine.
S27E19_997#Okay.
S27E19_998#W-Wait!
S27E19_1000#We never did things my way. 
S27E19_1002#Too late. : I'm already rolling downhill.
S27E19_1006#Ow, sharp rock.
S27E19_1007#Ooh, cactus!
S27E19_1008#More scorpions.
S27E19_1010#Is that all you can do? Sting?
S27E19_1012#Now they're pinching.
S27E19_1016#Easy, Flanders, don't make a sound.
S27E19_1018#Okay, here.
S27E19_1020#Come on, take this.
S27E19_1022#Oh, I got it.
S27E19_1024#Oh, it's heavy.
S27E19_1027#Ready to go.
S27E19_1031#Uh, we're too heavy.
S27E19_1033#Toss off what we don't need.
S27E19_1038#Fine. We can do without salad forks.
S27E19_1045#No sugar tonight for the coffee.
S27E19_1048#No sugar tonight for their tea.
S27E19_1050#We took all their fancy cheeses
S27E19_1053#and their tasty charcuterie.
S27E19_1059#Trout solo!
S27E19_1076#Grand Canyon! Yeah!
S27E19_1089#You know, Homer, we make a good team.
S27E19_1091#Homer?
S27E19_1099#Breakfast time.
S27E19_1101#Come and get it!
S27E19_1104#Come and get it!
S27E19_1105#Come and...
S27E19_1108#Ugh. Not again.
S27E19_1110#Tablecloths.
S27E19_1111#Caviar.
S27E19_1112#Bacon!
S27E19_1114#Bacon.
S27E19_1118#No, this was before Lisa was a vegetarian.
S27E19_1122#That's right. I had the arteries of a 20-year-old.
S27E19_1129#I'm gonna miss you, pal.
S27E19_1143#Well, Homer,
S27E19_1144#you think this will be one of those vacations
S27E19_1146#where the friendship we made will last forever
S27E19_1149#or start eroding the minute we enter our cars?
S27E19_1151#Flanders, like all friendships between men,
S27E19_1155#in the end it's up to our wives.
S27E19_1166#That was a nice story, Homer.
S27E19_1168#You know, sometimes I wish this Grand Canyon between us,
S27E19_1171#uh, wasn't so large.
S27E19_1172#The offer still stands.
S27E19_1173#You can live in my carcass.
S27E19_1175#There's room in my legs for the boys.
S27E19_1177#Maybe we could just store old clothes in you.
S27E19_1179#I'd like that.
S27E19_1181#And you know what, Flanders?
S27E19_1183#I think we owe you guys a trip.
S27E19_1194#Always wanted to visit the postcard museum.
S27E19_1196#Thank you.
S27E19_1197#My pleasure.
S27E19_1199#I wonder if they sell postcards in the gift shop.
S27E19_1201#We don't.
S27E20_171#Man, ever since you watched Medieval Tomb Robbers
S27E20_172#on the History Channel,
S27E20_174#everything with you is trover, trover, trover.
S27E20_177#Boy, either show me a writ of replevin
S27E20_179#or pipe down.
S27E20_185#*Chubby dude in a tiny car*
S27E20_188#*Making friends both near and far*
S27E20_192#*In this little town he's a shooting star*
S27E20_196#*That's a chubby dude*
S27E20_199#*In a tiny car*
S27E20_203#*From Shelbyville to Zanzibar*
S27E20_206#*It doesn't matter where you are*
S27E20_210#*There's not a thing that can com-par*
S27E20_216#*To a chubby dude in a tiny car*
S27E20_223#Aw, the needle's on "E."
S27E20_225#Uh, I got something that works as gasoline.
S27E20_238#- Daddy's home! ?- Daddy's home!?
S27E20_239#Hello, children.
S27E20_241#For you, daughter, a little ragdoll.
S27E20_244#For you, son, a Florida orange.
S27E20_246#You know, there's something truly amazing about you, Dad.
S27E20_248#Everything's an adventure.
S27E20_250#You go to clean the garage
S27E20_252#and you find a classic car.
S27E20_254#Yes, fortune favors the bald.
S27E20_256#Now for the best part
S27E20_258#sharing my great day with your mom.
S27E20_264#Well, if it isn't my favorite gal in my favorite room.
S27E20_267#I'm glad you had a good day.
S27E20_269#You don't sound glad.
S27E20_270#I'm not glad.
S27E20_272#But you said you were glad.
S27E20_274#You need to read between the lines.
S27E20_276#Why? There's just white space there.
S27E20_278#I'm sorry, Homie.
S27E20_280#Your life is full of fun surprises.
S27E20_283#My life sucks.
S27E20_286#Tissues?
S27E20_291#Well, would it help if I rubbed your back?
S27E20_296#Your hands smell like steering wheel.
S27E20_300#Poor Marge.
S27E20_301#What do I do?
S27E20_303#Help me, universe!
S27E20_307#- Jay Leno? - Hiya!
S27E20_310#I was just passing in my 1973 Citroen DS Pallas
S27E20_313#when I saw that classic Morgan
S27E20_315#with the original wood dash interior.
S27E20_316#Man, I-I'd like to buy it.
S27E20_318#You'll have to pay cash with no questions asked.
S27E20_320#How much you want?
S27E20_321#I said no questions!
S27E20_327#Don't worry, this car is a piece of art,
S27E20_329#going where it will be admired.
S27E20_331#To my secret underground car depository!
S27E20_340#It's time for me to do what I do best:
S27E20_342#prolong this marriage.
S27E20_344#You wanted a good surprise, Marge?
S27E20_345#You've got it.
S27E20_347#We are going on the trip of our lives.
S27E20_349#Really? Where?
S27E20_352#I'll be right back.
S27E20_354#Let your imagination run wild.
S27E20_356#Hey, Homer.
S27E20_358#- And you are...? - Jay Leno.
S27E20_360#Hey, do you still have that money I gave you for the car?
S27E20_362#- Sure do. - Well, uh, I'm gonna need it back.
S27E20_365#But I just promised my wife...
S27E20_367#Homer, I've collected hundreds of antique cars
S27E20_369#on the theory that they don't make 'em like they used to.
S27E20_371#Well, I just bought this new Toyota.
S27E20_372#Turns out it's much better.
S27E20_374#I can go to the store and make it all the way back,
S27E20_375#it doesn't break down once.
S27E20_377#Imagine that? Geez. 
S27E20_379#Yeah. Here's your money back.
S27E20_381#Can I have my car?
S27E20_383#Unfortunately, when I went to register it,
S27E20_384#it wasn't your car.
S27E20_385#So the-the police took it.
S27E20_388#*Chubby cop in a tiny car*
S27E20_391#*Going to the nearest cop bar...*
S27E20_393#Well, see ya.
S27E20_396#Unbelievable! It opens from here.
S27E20_398#The age we live in!
S27E20_400#I've decided where I want to go.
S27E20_402#Um, ooh, the trolley at the mall?
S27E20_405#No, Paris!
S27E20_407#The most romantic city in the world.
S27E20_412#Paris?
S27E20_413#What am I gonna do?
S27E20_419#A travel agent!
S27E20_421#Oh, thank God you're not obsolete yet.
S27E20_423#And a good morning to you, sir.
S27E20_425#Here's the problem.
S27E20_426#I've disappointed my wife so many times,
S27E20_428#I can't do it once more.
S27E20_429#I see.
S27E20_431#So I have to take her and our three kids to Paris.
S27E20_435#But here's the challenge: I have no money.
S27E20_438#Uh, let me see what I can do.
S27E20_441#Anything coming up?
S27E20_442#No, it's not plugged in.
S27E20_444#The noise helps me think.
S27E20_447#All right. There is a way...
S27E20_449#but it is a tad risky.
S27E20_451#Would you consider being a casual courier?
S27E20_455#You mean not like the fancy guys that ride the bicycles...
S27E20_457#Let me explain.
S27E20_459#The mob-- I mean, the courier company--
S27E20_461#will pay airfare and hotel,
S27E20_463#and all you have to do is deliver a package.
S27E20_466#But... you cannot look inside the package.
S27E20_470#Sure. For Marge, I will make the supreme sacrifice
S27E20_473#of not doing something.
S27E20_479#That's the "Package."
S27E20_480#What package?
S27E20_482#The package you're delivering.
S27E20_484#And the clients have asked me once more
S27E20_487#to remind you not to look inside.
S27E20_490#Hey, buddy, I didn't start doing this yesterday!
S27E20_493#I started doing it right now.
S27E20_496#Uh... the package?
S27E20_502#Paris!
S27E20_504#I can't believe it!
S27E20_505#Homer Simpson,
S27E20_507#just when I think you have nothing left to offer,
S27E20_510#you whisk me to the birthplace of existentialism.
S27E20_513#Now, if you'll excuse me,
S27E20_515#it's an 11-hour flight
S27E20_517#and I have to visit the "Louvre."
S27E20_525#Can't see the movie now.
S27E20_527#Everything's great.
S27E20_529#Absolutely great.
S27E20_530#Yet, there's something in that briefcase
S27E20_531#and it could get us in trouble.
S27E20_533#My mind's running wild.
S27E20_535#And you're not supposed to run on an airplane.
S27E20_537#Oh, that's it, I have to open the briefcase.
S27E20_547#Oh, what a cute, blue sna...
S27E20_555#Okay, first thing, I've gotta figure out
S27E20_558#if it can breathe in there.
S27E20_564#Better try the other eye.
S27E20_567#Okay, maybe the first eye again.
S27E20_568#What the...?
S27E20_569#I found it.
S27E20_571#It's an Amazon Blue Constrictor.
S27E20_574#Ooh, it's a very rare and endangered species.
S27E20_577#Oh, the trip of a lifetime.
S27E20_582#I can't break her heart.
S27E20_585#Well, you can't let anything bad happen to that snake.
S27E20_587#I promise.
S27E20_589#And you have to promise to preserve
S27E20_591#another endangered species... my marriage.
S27E20_593#I promise.
S27E20_596#Oh, for the first time, a snake has ruined paradise.
S27E20_606#I'll get the luggage.
S27E20_608#Marge, you and the kids grab a cab.
S27E20_610#A Parisian cab.
S27E20_612#Taxi. Taxi.
S27E20_615#Taxi.
S27E20_618#Are you casual courier Homer Simpson?
S27E20_619#I am.
S27E20_621#Here is your money.
S27E20_623#Finally. I've been here for two minutes.
S27E20_625#Listen, what's gonna happen to, uh, the package?
S27E20_628#Oh, it will have a fine home.
S27E20_630#A wonderful home.
S27E20_632#As the belt around the waist of a well-dressed woman.
S27E20_635#I am not gonna let you hurt that snake!
S27E20_641#You have to say "Lisa, catch" Before you throw it.
S27E20_643#Come on. 
S27E20_648#Where did they go?
S27E20_650#Maybe we shouldn't have stopped for that seven-course meal.
S27E20_654#Oh, maybe we should just have six, like peasants!
S27E20_660#So, back home we call this the tire fire.
S27E20_674#Man, look at those gargoyles.
S27E20_676#That's from back when religions still knew
S27E20_679#how to scare the crap out of you.
S27E20_680#Homie, I have to ask.
S27E20_682#Why are you carrying that briefcase?
S27E20_685#I just brought a little work.
S27E20_687#You don't even bring your work to work.
S27E20_690#I'm sorry. I just want this family
S27E20_692#to have one trip that's great.
S27E20_695#Not like Australia or Brazil, Japan, London,
S27E20_700#China, that World's Fair Bart drove to,
S27E20_703#that place with the underground jockeys...
S27E20_705#So, Dad, what are you gonna do with the snake?
S27E20_708#...Itchy and Scratchy Land,
S27E20_709#outer space...
S27E20_711#Lisa, I've come to understand
S27E20_713#a snake's natural habitat is not a briefcase.
S27E20_716#So I'm going to set him free.
S27E20_718#Oh, may I suggest the gardens of the Louvre?
S27E20_721#They're filled with delicious rats.
S27E20_730#It's a shame Lisa and your father 
S27E20_732#had that errand and couldn't join us.
S27E20_733#But on the upside...
S27E20_735#More pat¨¦ please!
S27E20_737#Vraiment? You want more pat¨¦?
S27E20_740#Yes, before my cruelty- free daughter shows up.
S27E20_743#Perhaps madam would like to order from our extra cruelty menu.
S27E20_746#We have a coq au vin made from an old rooster
S27E20_750#who was kicked to death in front of his wife and children.
S27E20_752#Very nice.
S27E20_754#On second thought, I'll just have a salad.
S27E20_756#Ah, tr¨¨s bien.
S27E20_758#Gilles, gouge the eyes out of some new potatoes!
S27E20_761#Ugh, I can't stand to look at this anymore.
S27E20_764#Bart, can you ditch this in the alley for me?
S27E20_782#Starving models.
S27E20_784#Well, Bart Simpson never met
S27E20_786#a beautiful woman he couldn't prank.
S27E20_788#Dad, I love being on a caper in France with you.
S27E20_791#Well, this is gonna be a snap.
S27E20_793#All we need is to get our tickets
S27E20_795#from this automatic French ticket dispenser.
S27E20_806#Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!
S27E20_810#Votre billet.
S27E20_812#Dad, you just bought a ticket to Argenteuil.
S27E20_815#Prochain client, s'il vous pla?t.
S27E20_817#Stop speaking French, damn you!
S27E20_820#Die Maschine nicht zu schlagen!
S27E20_821#Yes, sir.
S27E20_835#Here, skinny, skinny.
S27E20_836#Here, skinny, skinny.
S27E20_844#I've never been happier.
S27E20_848#Okay, you're free.
S27E20_850#Now, remember to respect this ecosystem.
S27E20_854#Come on, go.
S27E20_856#You'll be a snake that lives in Paris.
S27E20_858#It's a children's book that writes itself.
S27E20_860#Not so fast!
S27E20_862#How did you find us?
S27E20_864#All tourists come to the Louvre.
S27E20_866#Hey, it's got great paintings.
S27E20_868#Oh, yeah? Name two.
S27E20_875#Don't patronize us!
S27E20_877#You make belts from snakes.
S27E20_879#We treat our high fashion animals
S27E20_881#in the most humane manner.
S27E20_890#You're monsters.
S27E20_892#True, but that is just a part of who we are.
S27E20_894#We are also poets.
S27E20_895#Communists.
S27E20_896#Experts on mustard.
S27E20_898#They're gone!
S27E20_899#If we want to be criminals,
S27E20_900#we should keep a better eye on people.
S27E20_902#- It's really not that hard. - Do not worry.
S27E20_905#There is one surefire way to find the Americans.
S27E20_907#Marco!
S27E20_908#Polo!
S27E20_911#I say, "Marco!"
S27E20_912#Polo!
S27E20_914#Dad, control yourself.
S27E20_915#I got it.
S27E20_916#Marco!
S27E20_918#Polo! Oh, he tricked me.
S27E20_921#Marco! Marco! Marco! Marco!
S27E20_924#Polo!
S27E20_925#Now what are we gonna do with the snake?
S27E20_927#We'll just have to keep him with us.
S27E20_929#What is it, Lisa?
S27E20_931#Do you see a Burger King?
S27E20_933#We're at Rue Des Lombards,
S27E20_935#home of the three most famous jazz clubs in Paris.
S27E20_937#What do you think, dad?
S27E20_939#Just pull the rope, please.
S27E20_946#How old are you?
S27E20_947#Eight.
S27E20_948#Tr¨¨s bien.
S27E20_961#We need a doctor!
S27E20_963#And someone who can play saxophone!
S27E20_966#Oh, which is which?!
S27E20_967#I'll show you.
S27E20_976#I've never been happier.
S27E20_998#Plastered in Paris.
S27E20_1000#There's no better feeling.
S27E20_1009#Marge, there's something I need to tell you.
S27E20_1013#That briefcase.
S27E20_1015#I knew it was trouble.
S27E20_1017#Yes, this is my Battle of Essling.
S27E20_1020#Unless Napoleon had a more famous defeat I'm not aware of.
S27E20_1026#I've been smuggling this snake this whole trip.
S27E20_1028#But it was the only way I could pay for it,
S27E20_1031#and you wanted to go so badly.
S27E20_1033#And besides, those French crooks couldn't catch anybody.
S27E20_1036#There they are! No, no bridge!
S27E20_1038#We'll have to board a Bateau Mouche.
S27E20_1041#A little champagne, some dancing, and then...
S27E20_1044#They're gone again!
S27E20_1046#This joie de vivre is killing us.
S27E20_1048#Man, I never thought I'd be so glad
S27E20_1051#to get back to our own arrondissement.
S27E20_1054#Ooh-la-la-la-la.
S27E20_1056#You have despoiled our supermodels,
S27E20_1059#let an American perform with a French combo,
S27E20_1063#and stolen these poor gentlemen's snake.
S27E20_1067#Well, I guess this is the point that comes in every vacation
S27E20_1070#where I say... run! Run!
S27E20_1073#Okay, don't run.
S27E20_1075#Better cuff this one.
S27E20_1082#No snake!
S27E20_1083#What's on the desk?
S27E20_1086#Just a few dozen urgent messages from someone called "Grampa."
S27E20_1089#This one says the cat is eating his toast.
S27E20_1091#I have no time for cats and toast.
S27E20_1093#Search the room.
S27E20_1097#We have searched their room from armoire to bidet.
S27E20_1100#Eh, no snake.
S27E20_1101#Maybe we were wrong about you.
S27E20_1103#Let's see if the police dogs can do anything.
S27E20_1112#I keep telling you they're worthless.
S27E20_1114#But they're so damn cute.
S27E20_1118#All right, Simpsons, I apologize.
S27E20_1120#As for you, set the dogs on them.
S27E20_1125#Prepare to have your ankles nipped!
S27E20_1129#I just want to say that before we came,
S27E20_1132#our family was falling apart like your European Union.
S27E20_1135#But just a few days in your wonderful country,
S27E20_1138#and now we're better than ever.
S27E20_1140#All is forgiven, my friends.
S27E20_1142#Enjoy la douce France.
S27E20_1145#And now something we should have done the moment we met you.
S27E20_1150#Come on, you guys kiss like grandmas.
S27E20_1152#Get in there.
S27E20_1160#I don't know how we did it,
S27E20_1162#but we finally lucked into a great vacation.
S27E20_1165#In Paris, a lady makes her own luck.
S27E20_1180#Now my favorite part of each trip.
S27E20_1182#The gifts I brought back for my friends.
S27E20_1184#For Carl, a French Coca-Cola.
S27E20_1186#Ah, tr¨¨s chic.
S27E20_1188#For Lenny, a miniature Empire State Building.
S27E20_1191#We had a layover in New York.
S27E20_1194#And for Moe, a belt made out of a blue snake.
S27E20_1197#Artificial, I think.
S27E20_1198#Thank you.
S27E21_88#The September issue!
S27E21_106#Free wood!
S27E21_112#My treehouse sucks.
S27E21_115#You have class envy!
S27E21_116#Nelson, honey,
S27E21_118#I told you to stop sayin' "Haw-haw."
S27E21_121#Give me a dollar and I'll stop.
S27E21_122#I don't got a dollar.
S27E21_127#Do you want to practice your speech on me?
S27E21_129#No need, honey.
S27E21_131#Same speech I give every year.
S27E21_133#The opening joke about Lenny's grandma always kills.
S27E21_136#You can't joke about her--
S27E21_137#They just put her on life support.
S27E21_139#What?! No! She's the linchpin!
S27E21_142#It's okay, it's okay.
S27E21_144#Everyone is terrified of public speaking.
S27E21_146#But just in case, 
S27E21_148#I'll defrost a failure ham.
S27E21_154#You don't have faith in me! I have savers.
S27E21_157#If I get heckled, I'll say, "Get a half-life!"
S27E21_161#I'm sure that'll be funny to them.
S27E21_166#Calm down, Homer.
S27E21_168#Just leave your body.
S27E21_171#Oh, no!
S27E21_176#What the hell is this?!
S27E21_182#Ooh, throwing away your "No girls" sign?
S27E21_185#Is it time for you to have "The talk" with your dad?
S27E21_188#Because he's gonna have to read a few things first.
S27E21_190#No. I'm tearing it down.
S27E21_193#Ralph has a cool treehouse, and mine sucks.
S27E21_195#Well, Bart, your father built it,
S27E21_197#and he did the very best he could.
S27E21_202#I did my job. Now it's your turn, tree.
S27E21_204#Get growing.
S27E21_207#I'll tell you what, why don't I spruce it up for you. Huh?
S27E21_210#But you're an inside grown-up.
S27E21_212#Moms can't build treehouses.
S27E21_214#You realize that saying that
S27E21_216#is gonna make this mom work her keister off
S27E21_218#to make you the best darn treehouse you ever saw!
S27E21_222#Sounds good.
S27E21_225#Don't worry.
S27E21_226#You forget, most of that's hair.
S27E21_228#So I said,
S27E21_229#"Get a half-life!"
S27E21_238#Funny and handsome.
S27E21_240#And I hear he's loaded.
S27E21_241#Yes.
S27E21_243#Now, to end this perfect day on the perfect note,
S27E21_246#Mr. Homer Simpson.
S27E21_262#You're gonna do great, Homer. You're gonna kill.
S27E21_264#You're gonna-- oh, where did all these people come from?!
S27E21_272#Webster's dictionary defines... a speech
S27E21_276#as a... series of words that...
S27E21_280#elo... quently...
S27E21_282#I've never seen anyone bomb like that.
S27E21_284#Yeah. I really feel badly for the guy.
S27E21_294#I'm a failure.
S27E21_295#Shall I release the hounds, sir?
S27E21_297#Mm, the therapy hounds.
S27E21_304#Oh, oh, I feel a little better.
S27E21_307#Now release the real hounds.
S27E21_311#It's a pretty good seminar this year.
S27E21_314#Dad, what's wrong? Did your speech go badly?
S27E21_317#How do you know something's wrong?
S27E21_319#You're drinking from a can of corn.
S27E21_326#Aw, dad, do you know Barbra Streisand
S27E21_328#once forgot the words to a song
S27E21_330#and didn't perform in public again for nearly three decades?
S27E21_333#Yeah, but she still had James Brolin to cuddle.
S27E21_336#So, on a scale of ten to ten, how'd you do?
S27E21_345#Drip drop, you flop.
S27E21_347#Drip drop, you flop.
S27E21_349#Drip drop, you flop.
S27E21_351#- Drip drop, you flop. - Fail, fail, fail, fail...
S27E21_353#- Drip drop, you flop. - Fail, fail, fail, fail...
S27E21_355#What the hell is your problem, idiot!
S27E21_358#I don't know!
S27E21_360#I don't know!
S27E21_367#I know what will cheer you up.
S27E21_369#We'll go to the comedy club downtown.
S27E21_371#Downtown? With all those desperate addicts?
S27E21_374#Oh, the city cleaned them up and made them comics.
S27E21_376#Cool!
S27E21_378#Homie, you're gonna chuckle your blues away.
S27E21_381#This is the best kind of comedy.
S27E21_383#- No writers. - Amen to that, Marge.
S27E21_385#And I appreciate this,
S27E21_387#but I really resent the two-drink minimum!
S27E21_389#You always drink more than two drinks.
S27E21_390#But no one makes me.
S27E21_393#Three long island iced teas, please.
S27E21_397#Okay, we're gonna perform a little improv.
S27E21_399#First we need a location.
S27E21_401#Uh, 40.7 degrees north latitude,
S27E21_403#74 degrees west longitude.
S27E21_405#Ah, yes, New York City. Now we need a relationship
S27E21_407#for me and Cathy here.
S27E21_409#Loveless marriage!
S27E21_411#Okay, I heard loveless marriage.
S27E21_412#These guys are pros.
S27E21_414#All they did was ask for two premises.
S27E21_417#That's two more than you've asked for.
S27E21_418#Oh, boy.
S27E21_421#All right, all we need now is an object.
S27E21_422#Anyone.
S27E21_425#Fear of public speaking
S27E21_427#Sorry, didn't hear that.
S27E21_429#Oh... Fear of public speaking.
S27E21_432#Maybe he has trouble talking in the dark.
S27E21_434#Hey, Jerry, bring up number seven.
S27E21_436#No! Jerry, no!
S27E21_438#No! 
S27E21_440#Jerry, stop it! No! Don't...
S27E21_442#Oh, no! 
S27E21_446#Okay, okay, okay, um... Fear of public speaking.
S27E21_448#Well, that's not really an object,
S27E21_449#but we'll make it work.
S27E21_451#New York City, loveless marriage,
S27E21_453#fear of public speaking.
S27E21_456#They've pulled back the bow-- now let the arrow take flight.
S27E21_459#You know, I'm gonna move over a seat.
S27E21_461#We now take you to an apartment
S27E21_463#on 68th and Columbus avenue.
S27E21_472#What? What? Cathy, what's wrong?
S27E21_474#I-I... I-I...
S27E21_475#I... 
S27E21_478#Aw, for heaven's sakes, Cathy, when we got married,
S27E21_480#you used to speak for hours.
S27E21_482#But since we moved to New York City, nothing!
S27E21_485#Wow. It all magically fits.
S27E21_487#Come on, Cathy, say something! Anything!
S27E21_490#Fuggedaboutit!
S27E21_496#And scene!
S27E21_499#I said "Fear of public speaking."
S27E21_501#Yes, you did. Very nice. Return to your seat immediately.
S27E21_504#Wow. Wow. These guys do everything I can't.
S27E21_506#Maybe they can teach me.
S27E21_508#I don't know that they're interested in that.
S27E21_511#$500 for the first eight classes.
S27E21_513#That's kind of expensive.
S27E21_515#Couldn't people just form their own groups for free?
S27E21_517#And scene.
S27E21_522#Excuse me, is this the, uh,
S27E21_523#improv class?
S27E21_525#Yes, and... Come in.
S27E21_526#Sit anywhere?
S27E21_528#Yes, and... be quiet.
S27E21_532#This is it.
S27E21_534#I feel my mind exploding with premises.
S27E21_549#So many ideas,
S27E21_551#but how do I turn them into comedy?
S27E21_561#Homer, could-could you stay with us, please?
S27E21_562#I don't know how.
S27E21_564#The secret is to lose yourself
S27E21_566#And become, say, a suicidal auctioneer.
S27E21_569#I could not possibly imagine what such a person would say.
S27E21_572#Well, just remember, it's-it's not you.
S27E21_575#Don't you get it? The secret to life
S27E21_577#has been right in front of you.
S27E21_579#Don't be yourself!
S27E21_582#Uh, uh, okay.
S27E21_584#What am I bid for this noose?
S27E21_585#Do I hear $100?
S27E21_586#No?
S27E21_588#Going... Going...
S27E21_594#That's great! Really took my mind off my sick grandmother.
S27E21_598#Looks like the hospital left a message.
S27E21_601#- Gotta go. - See ya!
S27E21_603#It made me laugh.
S27E21_605#- So, then, you pay me? - No, never!
S27E21_607#And if you open your own school, we'll break your legs!
S27E21_609#You want to give him the one we can never crack?
S27E21_612#Queen of Norway buying a car.
S27E21_617#Oh, dear! I can't a-fjord it!
S27E21_620#A star is born.
S27E21_624#Excuse me.
S27E21_626#I'm from the city. Are you aware that you live
S27E21_628#in a historical treehouse preservation district?
S27E21_639#May I see your permits?
S27E21_641#I don't have permits.
S27E21_643#Don't worry.
S27E21_644#D-don't worry.
S27E21_645#I'll take care of it.
S27E21_652#I've got to hand it to you, dad.
S27E21_654#You went from fear of public speaking
S27E21_656#to starting your own improv troupe.
S27E21_658#Improv is exciting,
S27E21_659#but totally safe.
S27E21_661#Like driving a helicopter on the ground.
S27E21_663#Um, that's not safe.
S27E21_664#Don't deny the premise.
S27E21_666#That's anti-improv.
S27E21_668#Note for new character, "Auntie improv."
S27E21_670#May I hear a suggestion?
S27E21_673#People, don't freak out,
S27E21_675#but the improv critic from the Springfield Shopper
S27E21_678#is in the audience.
S27E21_680#Steve Thurlson?
S27E21_682#No, Thurlson is their improv reporter.
S27E21_684#Grant Hood is their improv critic.
S27E21_686#Then who's Jennifer Whitehead?
S27E21_687#Oh, she writes improv think pieces.
S27E21_689#You know, trends, big picture stuff.
S27E21_691#Who does the top ten list
S27E21_693#at end-of-year "Best of improv" issue?
S27E21_694#They each write their own.
S27E21_695#Oh, yeah.
S27E21_697#I forgot about that. That's true.
S27E21_703#Hi, everybody.
S27E21_705#We are "premises, premises."
S27E21_708#Yes, it says on google that there are 5,012 improv groups
S27E21_711#with that name.
S27E21_713#Take it, Homer.
S27E21_716#Uh, okay, I need a location.
S27E21_719#Uh, Jackson Square in New Orleans.
S27E21_721#And a type of person that might be there.
S27E21_724#Someone with confidence.
S27E21_726#Mm, I...
S27E21_728#I ga-ron-tee it!
S27E21_733#So, Tuesday is the treehouse warming.
S27E21_736#Nelson's gonna show us his mom's bra.
S27E21_738#That's the thing that boobs touch.
S27E21_741#Whoa, automatic blinds.
S27E21_744#Yeah, I think my mom put those in.
S27E21_745#No need to thank her.
S27E21_746#She's just doing her job.
S27E21_754#The keebler elves are real!
S27E21_758#Pass the gravy, Bart.
S27E21_759#Yo.
S27E21_760#Thank you.
S27E21_762#Geez, who ordered the crab?
S27E21_763#There's crab?
S27E21_764#There's no crab.
S27E21_766#There's no "thank you's", no appreciation.
S27E21_768#Nothing.
S27E21_772#Uh, who was that directed at?
S27E21_773#Bart!
S27E21_776#Pass the gravy, please.
S27E21_780#Dad! Dad!
S27E21_783#The Springfield Fringe Festival just invited us to perform.
S27E21_786#Huh? What's a "Fringe Festival"?
S27E21_788#My guess would be it's a three-day series of performances
S27E21_791#by alternative comedy and music acts,
S27E21_792#including, but not limited to,
S27E21_794#improv, stand-up, light circus work and ironic burlesque.
S27E21_797#We're gonna be on the main stage on closing night!
S27E21_800#This is going in my log.
S27E21_801#Yay!
S27E21_803#More crab for me.
S27E21_805#There's no crab!
S27E21_816#Aw, Marge, don't take it to heart.
S27E21_818#Kids are ungrateful, that's their job.
S27E21_820#You can cheer up watching me at the Fringe Festival.
S27E21_822#Good for you.
S27E21_825#The main stage, closing night, all eyes on you.
S27E21_828#Wh-wh-wh-what... What are you saying?
S27E21_830#Oh, she's making me nervous again.
S27E21_832#But now I'm a trained comedy amateur.
S27E21_833#No one can get in my head.
S27E21_835#Marge simpson,
S27E21_838#You don't want to accidentally undermine him like last time.
S27E21_841#Oh, thank god he doesn't know what I'm thinking.
S27E21_843#I know exactly what she's thinking.
S27E21_845#That if I mess this up, I'll be worse off than ever.
S27E21_847#He does know.
S27E21_849#She knows I know!
S27E21_853#- Homer? - Aw, what?
S27E21_855#I slept on it, and I'm madder than ever.
S27E21_856#Go get Bart.
S27E21_857#Oh my god, Marge,
S27E21_859#You woke up with morning-would-be-mad.
S27E21_862#Okay, I'll put this in your new language.
S27E21_864#Location, Bart's room.
S27E21_866#Action, bring him here.
S27E21_868#Can I get a character, please?
S27E21_869#Fine.
S27E21_871#A near-sighted Frankenstein.
S27E21_872#Okay.
S27E21_878#Bride! Bride!
S27E21_881#I do not look like the bride of Frankenstein.
S27E21_884#Don't deny premise.
S27E21_891#Mom, can I come in?
S27E21_893#You like your eggs a little runny don't you?
S27E21_895#What?
S27E21_896#And your toast set at four, with a little bit of butter?
S27E21_898#Yeah!
S27E21_900#Hash browns might be a little burnt.
S27E21_903#I like 'em however you make 'em, sweetie.
S27E21_905#I just wanted to say
S27E21_906#I'm sorry.
S27E21_908#We all forget just how many wonderful things you do.
S27E21_913#Y-you're making me cry.
S27E21_915#and best of all,
S27E21_917#You're as hot as the day I met you.
S27E21_921#Thank you!
S27E21_924#That apology speech you wrote worked like a charm, Pop.
S27E21_927#Your mother can't resist an apology
S27E21_929#that comes straight from the heart...
S27E21_930#of this box.
S27E21_935#Oh, dear god,
S27E21_937#This is not a renaissance faire, is it?
S27E21_939#Uh, that's in two weeks,
S27E21_941#Henry the weight problem.
S27E21_943#Gee, I don't know if I belong here with all this talent.
S27E21_945#Hey, reverend.
S27E21_947#Why didn't the dinosaurs make it on Noah's ark?
S27E21_950#Ooh, I give up.
S27E21_952#Because they didn't exist.
S27E21_961#Dad, this festival encourages experimentation.
S27E21_963#Even failure.
S27E21_965#Oh, what if I don't fail?
S27E21_967#Desperate times call for desperate measures.
S27E21_969#I am getting a helium balloon.
S27E21_970#That makes anyone funny.
S27E21_972#Be right back!
S27E21_977#Homer, are you okay?
S27E21_980#You look exactly like Barbara Streisand did in 1967.
S27E21_983#I can't think of anything funny.
S27E21_985#Homer, homer, relax, you're a riot.
S27E21_987#Remember how funny you was when you was the confident cajun?
S27E21_990#Look, just let me feed you the prompt.
S27E21_992#Wait, you mean cheat at improv?
S27E21_994#What would Del Close say?
S27E21_997#He would say, "Do like Moe says, and shut the hell up."
S27E21_999#Who's Del Close?
S27E21_1002#Only the author of the best book I intend to read someday.
S27E21_1005#Homer, the cemeteries are filled with people
S27E21_1007#Who didn't cheat at improv.
S27E21_1017#Okay, let's go over what you're gonna call out one more time.
S27E21_1020#Ethnicity, Cajun.
S27E21_1022#Location, Back Alley.
S27E21_1023#Good, good.
S27E21_1024#The back alley cajun bit.
S27E21_1025#Dad!
S27E21_1028#Are you cheating by planting suggestions?
S27E21_1030#Maybe.
S27E21_1033#Have you learned nothing from owning an unread copy
S27E21_1035#of Truth In Comedy?
S27E21_1037#It's either that or quit the show.
S27E21_1039#You can't let your troupe down.
S27E21_1041#They need your space work,
S27E21_1042#your strong choices,
S27E21_1043#And scene-building skills.
S27E21_1045#Hey, lay off your dad, huh?
S27E21_1047#Everything that's supposedly spontaneous
S27E21_1049#Has already been planned, okay?
S27E21_1051#Reality shows, uh, lip-sync singing, even...
S27E21_1054#awards shows.
S27E21_1055#No!
S27E21_1057#Yes, that's why the losers don't show up.
S27E21_1059#B-b-b-but they have scheduling conflicts.
S27E21_1060#Yeah, right.
S27E21_1062#Dave Franco has a scheduling conflict.
S27E21_1065#No, no, I've heard enough.
S27E21_1068#I refuse to use performance enhancing "Sugs."
S27E21_1073#It's Homer Simpson.
S27E21_1075#Homer simpson's here.
S27E21_1077#Okay, everyone, I'm Homer Simpson
S27E21_1079#and I need an occupation.
S27E21_1080#Cadaver salesman?
S27E21_1082#Drive-thru cashier.
S27E21_1084#Uh, frog gigger.
S27E21_1086#Finger kisser!
S27E21_1087#Nurse.
S27E21_1088#You'll have to be more specific.
S27E21_1090#I need a nurse!
S27E21_1092#Back alley Cajun!
S27E21_1096#A father I can look up to.
S27E21_1101#I hear... Drive-thru cashier!
S27E21_1104#You wha... ?
S27E21_1106#Hello, welcome to "Down and out burger"
S27E21_1108#Would you like fries with that?
S27E21_1109#A thousand?
S27E21_1111#Sure thing, Mr. Brando.
S27E21_1113#By the way, this is 1992.
S27E21_1119#And now we're going to do something a little special.
S27E21_1123#Our father is going to improve live answers to questions 
S27E21_1125#from the TV audience.
S27E21_1127#It only took us 27 years to do
S27E21_1130#what they could do in 1954.
S27E21_1132#Homer, time to bomb.
S27E21_1134#Hello!
S27E21_1137#I've gathered you here because I have an important announcement.
S27E21_1140#This is the last episode of "The simpsons."
S27E21_1143#It's been a great run.
S27E21_1144#Just kidding.
S27E21_1146#"The simpsons" will never end.
S27E21_1148#Now I've told you two lies,
S27E21_1150#and to prove there were live
S27E21_1153#On Saturday night live last night, Drake was terrible.
S27E21_1157#Now to take your calls.
S27E21_1159#Let's go to Hannah.
S27E21_1161#Hannah, you're talking to Homer.
S27E21_1165#Hi there, Homer. My question for you is 
S27E21_1167#who do do you like more -- 
S27E21_1169#Lenny or Carl -- and why?
S27E21_1171#Let's see.
S27E21_1174#I like Lenny because he's the black guy and
S27E21_1177#wait a minute, no.
S27E21_1179#Carl's the -- Wait. Let me get back to you 
S27E21_1182#when I figure out who's who.
S27E21_1183#Let's go to the next question.
S27E21_1184#Amanda?
S27E21_1189#I was wondering if you could give me any tips or tricks 
S27E21_1190#for making it look like I'm hard at work
S27E21_1192#but really I'm relaxing or taking a nap
S27E21_1195#Always wear glasses with eyes
S27E21_1197#glued onto them.
S27E21_1199#Next question.
S27E21_1202#George, I think.
S27E21_1204#Hello, George.
S27E21_1206#Hello, Homer.
S27E21_1207#What's your question?
S27E21_1209#So my question is pizza-related.
S27E21_1213#Do you prefer chicago deep dish or New York-style?
S27E21_1217#Let's see. I prefer chicago deep dish
S27E21_1222#because I like Italian better than Chinese.
S27E21_1226#And now let's go to a planted call 
S27E21_1229#with a planted question.
S27E21_1231#Let's go to -- hello?
S27E21_1234#Homer, how are you doing?
S27E21_1236#I'm doing all right. Is that your question?
S27E21_1238#I was wondering what kind of car do you drive?
S27E21_1242#Oh, I drive a hybrid which is a combination of old and terrible.
S27E21_1245#Next caller.
S27E21_1248#Chris. Yes, chris. What's your question?
S27E21_1251#Or comment.
S27E21_1253#My question is what's your favorite job?
S27E21_1255#What was your favorite job?
S27E21_1258#My favorite job would have been being an astronaut
S27E21_1261#because everything was done for me.
S27E21_1265#And also I could get away from boy.
S27E21_1267#Well, that's it.
S27E21_1269#That's it, ladies and gentlemen.
S27E21_1271#We have come to my closing remarks.
S27E21_1273#It only lasted three minutes,
S27E21_1275#like eating cheeseburgers and making love.
S27E21_1277#If your call hasn't been taken yet, 
S27E21_1279#please continue to hold.
S27E21_1282#The cast of "Empire" Will be answering questions Wednesday night.
S27E21_1285#Someone will let them know.
S27E21_1288#Flashing by are the credits of people 
S27E21_1290#who worked long and hard on this.
S27E21_1292#I have no idea who they are.
S27E21_1294#Now the show is over.
S27E21_1297#The spotlight dims, the laughter fades. Someone call uber.
S27E21_1300#If Bart would just return my pants 
S27E21_1302#so I can move from behind this desk.
S27E21_1307#Wait on the pants.
S27E21_1309#Oh, Bart. Not culottes. No...
S27E22_143#to determine the vertical.
S27E22_146#With this mechanical marvel,
S27E22_149#we'll have this poster level in under three hours.
S27E22_155#Ooh, and for a little excitement,
S27E22_157#how about a plumb bob song?
S27E22_161#All right. Um...
S27E22_164#*One must never, never*
S27E22_165#*Never rush*
S27E22_167#*The plumb bob*
S27E22_169#*Slow is the way*
S27E22_171#*The only way to go*
S27E22_174#*Clear your schedule*
S27E22_177#*Before you use the plumb bob*
S27E22_180#*Yes, the plumb bob*
S27E22_182#*Is mighty, mighty*
S27E22_184#*Mighty*
S27E22_190#*Slow*
S27E22_196#Maggie's had her bath,
S27E22_198#dinner's on the stove.
S27E22_201#Dare I pop a cork?
S27E22_204#Give me a spin, Marge. You're so deft.
S27E22_207#Not like... him.
S27E22_209#Mom. Mom!
S27E22_211#My costume for the science play is all wrong!
S27E22_213#You said you were a seahorse.
S27E22_215#A male seahorse.
S27E22_216#With a pouch.
S27E22_218#Males have pouches?
S27E22_220#Male seahorse's nurturing is one of the wonders of the world.
S27E22_223#You said you read the script.
S27E22_225#Bart gave me a synopsis.
S27E22_228#Oh, boy.
S27E22_230#Oh, now what?
S27E22_240#Eat your carrot and pea medley.
S27E22_245#Mom, I'll clean that up for you.
S27E22_247#Oh, thank God, some help.
S27E22_249#- Where's the mop? - In the mop closet.
S27E22_251#- Where's the bucket? - Under the mop.
S27E22_253#Other closet.
S27E22_255#There's stuff in front of it.
S27E22_258#Let me help.
S27E22_264#Hey, there's wood underneath this linoleum.
S27E22_267#Oh! Just go play outside.
S27E22_270#Outside? Your loss.
S27E22_277#I do not get what kids see in these places.
S27E22_284#It's the genie of the sub.
S27E22_286#Genie? I wish.
S27E22_287#You get a lamp and a carpet,
S27E22_289#which is more than I've got in here.
S27E22_291#Hmm, didn't know this place was filled with such losers.
S27E22_292#Hey, Martin.
S27E22_294#Bartholomew!
S27E22_296#This playground has safely stimulated my imagination.
S27E22_299#What the hell are you talking about?
S27E22_301#Martin.
S27E22_303#Who's your new friend?
S27E22_305#Mother, don't blow this for me.
S27E22_308#Fine, I'll just go sit and talk to his mother.
S27E22_310#Where is she?
S27E22_311#I'm here by myself.
S27E22_313#But I have a safety number.
S27E22_315#Moe's tavern. Homer ain't here.
S27E22_317#And for once, that's the truth.
S27E22_326#Simpson, are you here unsupervised?
S27E22_328#Yeah. And so what?
S27E22_331#I'd lose the attitude, "Sylvester Alone."
S27E22_335#Finally, a laugh out of Lou.
S27E22_337#Son, kids aren't allowed on their own anymore.
S27E22_340#Now, who said you could come here?
S27E22_341#My mom.
S27E22_343#Always the mom.
S27E22_352#She's got needles.
S27E22_360#What did Bart do now?
S27E22_361#I was playing nicely in the park.
S27E22_363#Bart, how could you... What?
S27E22_365#Your children need to be supervised.
S27E22_367#Take her away, boys.
S27E22_369#If you take me away, then who's gonna watch my kids?
S27E22_371#You should've thought of that
S27E22_373#before we showed up unannounced.
S27E22_375#What, Marge?
S27E22_377#You're being arrested?
S27E22_379#I'm afraid so, Mr. Simpson.
S27E22_381#A mother at the park saw something she disapproved of.
S27E22_384#And luckily for your son, she overreacted.
S27E22_391#I, uh... I get carsick in the front.
S27E22_399#Our top story, a Springfield mother
S27E22_402#has been arrested for an outrageous "Neglig¨¦e."
S27E22_404#The...
S27E22_406#Sorry, I'm being told it's negligence.
S27E22_408#Which is very boring.
S27E22_410#Judge, I don't understand.
S27E22_412#When I was a kid, we used to go out and play
S27E22_415#and not come home until dark.
S27E22_416#I see.
S27E22_417#Bailiff, incarcerate Marge Simpsons' mother.
S27E22_421#Thanks for ratting me out, Marge
S27E22_425#With all due respect, Judge,
S27E22_426#this is wackadoodle.
S27E22_428#Nobody cares about their kids more than I do.
S27E22_430#Liar.
S27E22_431#Marge is right, Your Honor.
S27E22_433#My e-mail password is "Bad dad."
S27E22_435#Yeah, Judge.
S27E22_436#If you want to know who should be in jail,
S27E22_438#he weighs 240 and smells like onions.
S27E22_442#It is not within the purview of this court
S27E22_444#to determine how fat and smelly your father may be.
S27E22_447#Mrs. Simpsons, 90 days.
S27E22_454#This is Kafkaesque.
S27E22_455#Kafkaesque!
S27E22_456#I've got my eye on you.
S27E22_458#Now it's Orwellian.
S27E22_465#Hey, kitties.
S27E22_466#You got a new ball of yarn.
S27E22_469#Oh, that guard is awfully slammy.
S27E22_472#Newbies on top.
S27E22_474#Oh. Where's the ladder?
S27E22_478#Have you been claimed yet?
S27E22_479#Claimed?
S27E22_480#By one of the book clubs.
S27E22_483#Yeah, we read a little, dig a little,
S27E22_485#read a little, dig a little,
S27E22_487#kiss a little, dig a little.
S27E22_494#Homer, I think you're supposed to cook sausage.
S27E22_497#What's the point?
S27E22_499#Well, hi there, Homer.
S27E22_502#I know a time like this is when a man really needs his neighbor.
S27E22_505#Yeah, well, thanks for the check-in.
S27E22_508#Well, this is more than a check-in.
S27E22_510#It's a chance to do good for us boys in the hood!
S27E22_512#Just call us NWA,
S27E22_514#"Neighbors With Appetizers."
S27E22_520#I really am the richest man in town.
S27E22_522#Not rich in money,
S27E22_524#but in what really matters: pity.
S27E22_528#And what happened to Marge is a wake up call for us all.
S27E22_531#There's no greater crime than half-assed parenting.
S27E22_533#Kirk, where's Milhouse?
S27E22_535#On the leash, baby. On the leash.
S27E22_537#He's too far.
S27E22_539#Retract. Retract!
S27E22_542#Why'd you pull me back?
S27E22_544#Some new kids were just about to give me a chance.
S27E22_546#Don't try anything new, son.
S27E22_549#I could've married a woman who didn't look exactly like me.
S27E22_552#But that would've been crazy.
S27E22_556#Hey, newbie.
S27E22_558#Nobody touches the new James Patterson
S27E22_560#until Solar reads it first.
S27E22_568#She wants you to pick it up.
S27E22_571#You scared, huh?
S27E22_587#Anybody else want a taste of Blue Thunder?
S27E22_589#Uh, I do. Yeah.
S27E22_592#Now, if you ladies recall what this place
S27E22_594#is supposed to be for...
S27E22_596#Smokin' weed?
S27E22_597#Reading!
S27E22_604#Dad, if this is what they send
S27E22_605#when mom goes to jail,
S27E22_607#just imagine what happens when you kick the bucket.
S27E22_610#Oh, man, that's gonna be so awesome.
S27E22_613#Dad, Dad! You're eating a teddy bear!
S27E22_615#That's my stomach's problem.
S27E22_617#Okay, Homer, I just changed all the linens,
S27E22_620#diapered the dog for modesty,
S27E22_622#and replaced the batteries in the smoke detectors,
S27E22_623#which were all bad.
S27E22_625#One was just a candy dish with a red light painted on.
S27E22_627#Was there any candy in it?
S27E22_628#There is now.
S27E22_629#Oh, Flanders.
S27E22_632#It turns out there's a good side to you after all.
S27E22_635#Well, sir, maybe I know a little bit about what it's like
S27E22_637#to lose the lady of the house.
S27E22_640#Oh, I think I heard a dryer ding.
S27E22_642#Thank you, Mr. Flanders.
S27E22_643#Tell your boys I want to hang.
S27E22_645#Flanders is great.
S27E22_647#I've always said that.
S27E22_648#But we can't forget your mother.
S27E22_661#Oh, my first prison flower.
S27E22_664#Can it be? Am I starting to like it in here?
S27E22_667#Exercise time!
S27E22_671#I never have time to exercise.
S27E22_673#Is this a prison or a spa?
S27E22_676#It's a prison.
S27E22_684#Hey, uh, are there any more chocolate chip muffins?
S27E22_687#Sorry, Dad. The only ones left have caraway seeds.
S27E22_690#Oh. I miss your mother so much.
S27E22_693#Shockingly, these gift baskets
S27E22_695#haven't solved anything.
S27E22_697#Wait, Dad. That one that looks like blueberry
S27E22_698#actually has M&M'S.
S27E22_700#Oh. Oh, thank God. Everything's okay.
S27E22_703#But for how long?
S27E22_705#Mom, I really, really miss you.
S27E22_708#Also, I have a field trip form
S27E22_709#that needs to be signed for school.
S27E22_711#I think if I mail it to you at the prison
S27E22_713#it's still easier than getting it from Dad.
S27E22_714#I want to talk to Mom.
S27E22_716#Can you send me a shiv for show and tell?
S27E22_717#Preferably with blood on it.
S27E22_719#Hey, give me the phone.
S27E22_721#Are my blue pants done at the prison laundry?
S27E22_723#Remember to sign my form.
S27E22_724#Shiv with blood.
S27E22_725#Press my pants.
S27E22_728#The electric chair.
S27E22_730#And then he thought it was the electric chair.
S27E22_734#8:00. Lights out.
S27E22_737#Really? 8:00? I get to go to bed?
S27E22_740#I don't have to clean a sink full of dishes,
S27E22_741#or write a paragraph
S27E22_743#with topic sentence for Homer?
S27E22_752#Aw, you're tired too.
S27E22_754#Everyone goes to sleep so easily here.
S27E22_758#Marge, your positivity is contagious.
S27E22_761#I'm starting to believe I really will show everyone.
S27E22_764#Simpson, you got a visitor.
S27E22_767#Oh, gee, now? It's a shame to go inside.
S27E22_771#Okay, let's move in the body now.
S27E22_778#Marge, I got great news.
S27E22_780#We hired the one good lawyer in town.
S27E22_783#Yes, Mrs. Simpson, I got you off on a technicality.
S27E22_786#Since your husband never filed for a birth certificate,
S27E22_788#Bart isn't legally your son.
S27E22_790#How about that?
S27E22_791#Why aren't you saying anything, Marge?
S27E22_793#You're free. Free.
S27E22_795#Now, it's not the world you remember.
S27E22_797#The girl at the coffee place that left?
S27E22_798#Came back.
S27E22_800#So you'll have that to get used to.
S27E22_802#I'm free?
S27E22_803#Oh, and just in time.
S27E22_805#Bart's claiming he's in another dimension,
S27E22_808#but I think he's just hiding in the closet.
S27E22_810#I had 90 days.
S27E22_813#I was promised 90 days.
S27E22_818#Now you have to give me more time.
S27E22_820#Oh, you don't.
S27E22_822#I can't go to another school meeting.
S27E22_823#I can't!
S27E22_825#Everyone just asks about their own kid.
S27E22_827#Hey, you like shopping? 
S27E22_829#'Cause you just bought yourself two more months.
S27E22_833#Sorry, Homie. I can't go back yet.
S27E22_836#Just tell me where the soap for the dishwasher goes
S27E22_837#and how do I...
S27E22_842#Marge would rather stay in prison than come home to me.
S27E22_845#I have to reexamine my entire life.
S27E22_848#Yeah, maybe you can start by not bringing your kids to the bar.
S27E22_852#Yeah, it's kind of funny-- Homer takes his kids to a saloon,
S27E22_855#but Marge is in jail for being a bad parent.
S27E22_857#I guess somebody up there likes me.
S27E22_860#Do you like him?
S27E22_861#Uh, not really, no.
S27E22_863#I've got to change, show Marge I can help around the house.
S27E22_866#More than just turning up the TV when she vacuums.
S27E22_870#I've got to become the perfect homemaker.
S27E22_901#Oh, I was doing so great,
S27E22_903#but it turned out I was a secret alcoholic.
S27E22_905#Yeah, good thing it's just your imagination.
S27E22_909#Oh, yeah.
S27E22_911#When we said we'd take turns watching all the kids,
S27E22_913#I never thought it would be my turn.
S27E22_915#Why did I get the choke chain?
S27E22_918#Go around this side of the tree.
S27E22_920#This side of the tree. This side of the tree!
S27E22_922#No, Ralph. No!
S27E22_925#Hi, Mr. Bobcat.
S27E22_928#You're in charge, boy.
S27E22_931#Now, listen, Bobcat.
S27E22_936#Are you as sick as I am of having grown-ups
S27E22_937#everywhere you go?
S27E22_940#I say we sneak off to the park and have fun by ourselves.
S27E22_943#Great idea. I'll text my mom.
S27E22_947#My Jitterbug senior phone!
S27E22_949#Jitterbug call center.
S27E22_951#If you've fallen and need assistance, press one.
S27E22_954#If you're lonely and want to talk, press disconnect.
S27E22_979#Oh, I really miss my family.
S27E22_981#I thought they were letting you out.
S27E22_983#I just wasn't ready for the outside.
S27E22_986#I didn't realize how much I needed a break.
S27E22_989#But maybe not a prison break.
S27E22_991#Prison break? Prison break! Yeah!
S27E22_999#All right, all our parents
S27E22_1001#think we're playing after-school rugby with Willie.
S27E22_1003#What... Where's me scrum?
S27E22_1005#Time for unsupervised play!
S27E22_1007#I'm going down the hot slide in shorts.
S27E22_1010#I'm gonna freckle.
S27E22_1013#I'm gonna ride the hobbyhorse English style.
S27E22_1019#Finally-- kids having fun the way they were meant to.
S27E22_1022#It just proves that danger is not the rule,
S27E22_1024#but the exception.
S27E22_1026#Tornado!
S27E22_1033#This is Kent Brockman covering two of the biggest stories 
S27E22_1035#of the year: a tornado and a prison break,
S27E22_1038#while I report safely from the Channel Six Emmy Watch bunker.
S27E22_1041#Arnie Pye, what's the situation?
S27E22_1043#I'm-I'm about to die, Kent.
S27E22_1045#And worst of all is the fact that your voice
S27E22_1048#is the last one I'll ever hear,
S27E22_1050#you pompous snow monkey!
S27E22_1057#Homer, what are you doing here?
S27E22_1059#I had to do whatever it takes to get you to leave.
S27E22_1061#So I dressed up as a prison guard.
S27E22_1063#Now I'd better not blow my cover.
S27E22_1065#Get back. Get back.
S27E22_1067#Okay, a little forward.
S27E22_1069#Now back! Back! Back!
S27E22_1071#Now forward.
S27E22_1073#And back! Back! Back!
S27E22_1075#It's very sweet that you came for me.
S27E22_1078#I know things won't always be perfect-- --
S27E22_1080#but they'll be better than fighting off prison inmates
S27E22_1082#in a tornado.
S27E22_1085#I believe you.
S27E22_1088#And I want to go home.
S27E22_1096#Come on, man. Take the shot.
S27E22_1099#No, I can't. I'll fire a warning shot at her hair.
S27E22_1102#Oh, she uses too much product.
S27E22_1104#Don't worry. All the kids are accounted for
S27E22_1107#except for, uh... Raife Waggum.
S27E22_1110#Well, I have a sad call to make.
S27E22_1115#Huh. Busy.
S27E22_1117#Bart, would you like some extra bacon?
S27E22_1118#Sure would, Mom.
S27E22_1120#Okay, but you owe me.
S27E22_1122#Sorry, sorry, force of habit.
S27E22_1124#It's okay, Mom. Whatever you want, just glad you're back.
S27E22_1126#Geez, ever since I got sprung from the hoosegow,
S27E22_1129#you kids have been kind of clingy.
S27E22_1131#No, Mom, we're just really glad to have you back.
S27E22_1134#And we're not nuts or anything, 
S27E22_1136#but please don't let the refrigerator door block my view of you.
S27E22_1140#Hmm, I need some spices from the pantry.
S27E22_1142#I'm coming, too.
S27E22_1144#Oh, you're pathetic.
S27E22_1146#Let me in.
S27E22_1148#Now, kids, give your mother a little peace and...
S27E22_1159#I want to say two things:
S27E22_1161#I love you guys and we're out of peanut butter.
S29E01_33#Aw, water soup again?
S29E01_38#Now it's crow soup.
S29E01_39#Ooh, I call an eye!
S29E01_41#- Me, two! ?- Me, three!
S29E01_43#And Maggie gets the beak.
S29E01_52#Your hovel got in the way of my horse.
S29E01_55#Kiss his hooves in apology.
S29E01_58#Oh, please, forgive us, noble steed.
S29E01_61#Our nostrils are not worthy of your mighty stench.
S29E01_65#Are those new horseshoes?
S29E01_67#Oh, they look good on you!
S29E01_74#Lousy nobles!
S29E01_76#We serfs are starving, while they're feasting
S29E01_79#and jousting and posing for tapestries
S29E01_81#where they're friends with a unicorn.
S29E01_82#As if any unicorn would like them.
S29E01_84#Unicorns like nice people-- I'm a nice person.
S29E01_87#Young lady, that kind of talk is anti-feudalist,
S29E01_89#and I won't have it!
S29E01_91#Without feudalism, we wouldn't have this hovel,
S29E01_94#our bountiful filth, or my awesome buboes.
S29E01_97#Ooh-hoo. I'll lance you later.
S29E01_102#Bart! They just stuck new severed heads up
S29E01_104#on the city walls!
S29E01_106#Oh! Can we go, Ma? Can we? Can we?
S29E01_109#That's a lovely idea.
S29E01_111#Oh. And we can bring my mom.
S29E01_113#I hope she's doing okay in her new nursing home.
S29E01_119#Which one is your mom's web?
S29E01_121#Son, is that you?
S29E01_122#No.
S29E01_125#Ah, you ruined my nap!
S29E01_127#Just like you ruined my daughter's life.
S29E01_128#That's her.
S29E01_134#They didn't skimp on the tar.
S29E01_136#That's the secret to long-lasting heads.
S29E01_139#Ooh, there's Ned Flanders!
S29E01_142#It's always nice when you know someone.
S29E01_145#Those are the kind of sideburns I was saying you should grow.
S29E01_149#Pretty sharp.
S29E01_151#Pretty, pretty sharp.
S29E01_153#See how the heads of rich people
S29E01_155#get the tallest pikes with the best view?
S29E01_156#It's so unfair.
S29E01_158#I told you to lay off feudalism.
S29E01_160#It's the only system we know.
S29E01_162#We have no choice about it, and therefore it's the best.
S29E01_165#The system is designed to keep us down.
S29E01_167#That's not true.
S29E01_169#In a great country like ours,
S29E01_171#a poor girl can grow up to be anything she wants--
S29E01_174#a wife or a harlot and... that's it.
S29E01_178#I wanted to be a harlot, but it's all who you know.
S29E01_180#It's never too late.
S29E01_182#Everyone is somebody's weird fetish.
S29E01_186#Mom. What's wrong with your skin?
S29E01_188#It's blue, and ice-cold.
S29E01_191#This could be a serious disease.
S29E01_193#Homer, she needs medical attention.
S29E01_196#Pretty, pretty sharp.
S29E01_201#It's never easy to say this.
S29E01_203#You've got... Genital Snerfs.
S29E01_210#Doc, is there any way to control occasional flare-ups?
S29E01_212#Nope.
S29E01_213#Yeah! ?Yay! ?Yippee!
S29E01_217#Now, what have we here?
S29E01_219#Progressive frozen-mortification!
S29E01_222#This can only be the bite
S29E01_224#of an Ice Walker!
S29E01_225#An Ice Walker?
S29E01_227#Mom, how did this happen?
S29E01_229#Oh, I dated a ravenous wight
S29E01_232#who abhors the warmth of the living.
S29E01_234#- And? ?- He got fresh.
S29E01_236#I'm sorry, baby. I know I screwed up.
S29E01_238#But you got to give me another chance.
S29E01_239#I love you.
S29E01_242#She's 900 years younger than you, you pervert.
S29E01_245#I like 'em young, that ain't no crime.
S29E01_249#Is my mom gonna be okay?
S29E01_251#Mm, I'm sorry, but a week from now,
S29E01_254#your mother will be frozen solid.
S29E01_256#No! No, that can't be.
S29E01_258#She's barely into her hag years.
S29E01_260#All you can do is give her leeches for the pain.
S29E01_263#Here's an organizer.
S29E01_266#So... so there's nothing we can do to save her?
S29E01_270#well, there's one treatment.
S29E01_272#All we have to do is buy this amulet.
S29E01_274#My mom is saved!
S29E01_276#Yeah...
S29E01_278#but a hundred GP?
S29E01_280#I mean, that's more than a tenth-level fighter makes
S29E01_282#in an entire campaign.
S29E01_284#Don't worry, we'll figure it out.
S29E01_287#Hey, sweet young thang.
S29E01_290#What time they cuttin' you down?
S29E01_292#Ooh, baby!
S29E01_299#Okay, we just need to come up with a hundred gold pieces.
S29E01_302#How much do we have in our savings?
S29E01_304#Hmm... let me think.
S29E01_306#There's that thing...
S29E01_310#What are savings?
S29E01_313#Well, then we can sell our possessions.
S29E01_315#The pig. The spoon. ?
S29E01_317#The gelatinous cube has to be worth something.
S29E01_320#Is this because of what happened to the cat?
S29E01_323#I told him not to nap on me. So... that's on him.
S29E01_326#Look, honey, I love your mom.
S29E01_329#As crones go, she's tops.
S29E01_332#But does it make sense
S29E01_335#I mean total sense to spend all that money
S29E01_339#so a really old lady can get a little bit older?
S29E01_342#This is my mom's life!
S29E01_344#This family will do whatever it takes to keep her alive!
S29E01_346#Is that understood?
S29E01_347#Of course. Of course.
S29E01_349#- Good. - ?Good.
S29E01_350#Good.
S29E01_353#All I'm saying is...
S29E01_356#Homer Serfson,
S29E01_359#you are the most selfish jerk in the entire Tri-Kingdom Area!
S29E01_362#I should have listened to that witch
S29E01_364#and married my twin brother, Markery.
S29E01_366#Always here if you need me, sis.
S29E01_369#Get lost, freak! She chose me!
S29E01_371#You get that money to save my mom,
S29E01_373#or never set foot in this hovel again!
S29E01_377#Good things come to those who wait.
S29E01_386#Is Marge still sore at you, Homer?
S29E01_388#Yeah. It's not like I want to kill her mother.
S29E01_391#I just want to let her die from neglect.
S29E01_393#If I don't get the money for that amulet,
S29E01_395#I'll be sleeping on the iron couch.
S29E01_401#Now, let's see here. "An urgent message
S29E01_403#for Milady Gwendolyn Partz."
S29E01_406#Uh, Milady Partz?
S29E01_408#Hey, has anyone seen Milady Partz?
S29E01_410#Ah, come on, somebody grab Milady Partz!
S29E01_413#That depends, how big is your dowry?
S29E01_418#You little craven, if I ever get my hands on you,
S29E01_421#I'm gonna slice you open and drain all of your humors:
S29E01_424#blood, black bile, yellow bile...
S29E01_426#"...and phlegm."
S29E01_438#Okay, break's over.
S29E01_445#Uh, Lord Montgomery?
S29E01_448#I've had some unforeseen family medical expenses,
S29E01_451#and I was wondering, could I get an advance on my salary?
S29E01_454#Uh, but first, can I have a salary?
S29E01_457#Peasants.
S29E01_459#Serfson, you've pushed that wheel around and around
S29E01_462#for 20 years, did you ever wonder why?
S29E01_465#Mostly I just push it.
S29E01_466#Have you ever noticed that the wheel
S29E01_468#isn't hooked up to anything?
S29E01_471#The rumors were true!
S29E01_473#But your work does produce something very special
S29E01_475#human misery
S29E01_477#which, when collected, ground into a powder and snorted, 
S29E01_481#gives rich people tiny wings that do nothing.
S29E01_484#So if you help me, it reduces my suffering,
S29E01_487#which means less wing powder for my betters.
S29E01_489#I'm glad we had this talk.
S29E01_491#- But I really need the money - ?Flit-flit.
S29E01_493#Thank you for your time.
S29E01_500#Hi, Azzlan.
S29E01_502#Marge, my child.
S29E01_505#I've come to offer solace in this difficult time.
S29E01_508#You mean convert me to your religion
S29E01_510#when I'm at my most vulnerable?
S29E01_512#Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
S29E01_515#I'm just here to ask you an important question.
S29E01_518#Have you heard the news?
S29E01_520#Yes, yes. I will be saved.
S29E01_522#Thanks so much for stopping by.
S29E01_524#I'm just going to leave you with this literature, praise God...
S29E01_527#I can't go home and face your mom
S29E01_529#without the money for that amulet.
S29E01_531#In here.
S29E01_534#Do you have your lucky lead nugget?
S29E01_535#Always.
S29E01_537#A lead-lick a day
S29E01_539#keeps the doctor a-blah...
S29E01_552#Gold. Sweet, sweet gold!
S29E01_554#Why didn't you ever tell us you could do magic?
S29E01_557#Because if the king finds out, he'll take me away
S29E01_559#and force me to be one of his evil wizards!
S29E01_561#You necromancing nitwits!
S29E01_564#I wanted an all-seeing eye, not this!
S29E01_568#No daughter of mine is gonna end up in the hex trade.
S29E01_571#Now, let's go buy that amulet.
S29E01_573#And don't worry, mum's the word.
S29E01_575#Did you say "The Word"?
S29E01_580#Hi, Azzlan.
S29E01_583#12-nothing.
S29E01_584#My serve.
S29E01_587#You know, eventually, you're gonna run out of us.
S29E01_590#I said, my serve.
S29E01_592#Mom, I've got a surprise for you.
S29E01_595#Thanks to who?
S29E01_597#I said it when I was 11, and I'll say it now.
S29E01_600#You're the greatest husband in the world.
S29E01_605#Where'd a dirt-poor loser like you
S29E01_607#get all the gold for that?
S29E01_608#Oh, well...
S29E01_610#let's just say...
S29E01_612#I strangled a leprechaun.
S29E01_615#I'm not wearing that.
S29E01_617#But without it, you'll die.
S29E01_619#- Fine by me. ?- What?!
S29E01_622#I want to die.
S29E01_623#Oh, typical!
S29E01_625#"I want to live, I want to die."
S29E01_627#Just make up your mind-- they're both terrible.
S29E01_630#Oh, I've lived a full life.
S29E01_633#I saw a drawing of an ocean,
S29E01_636#I watched my daughter marry an ogre.
S29E01_639#I am not an ogre.
S29E01_641#My father married an ogre
S29E01_644#after my mother was eaten by a different ogre.
S29E01_648#You're my mom.
S29E01_650#I can't bear the thought of saying good-bye.
S29E01_658#You want me to live, I'll live.
S29E01_666#Let's celebrate!
S29E01_668#I'll roast a hobbit for dinner.
S29E01_671#Bet you a packet
S29E01_673#of South Farthing pipe weed she picks me, Gaffer.
S29E01_675#Hush now, lad.
S29E01_677#The big folk will choose who's tastiest and no mistake.
S29E01_682#Hey! How do you know you got them from me?
S29E01_684#We miss you!
S29E01_685#We miss you, too!
S29E01_687#Love you!
S29E01_688#Love you more!
S29E01_695#Is it really so bad for Grandma if she dies?
S29E01_698#Won't she spend eternity in the Fields of Bliss?
S29E01_702#Yeah. We're all going to the Fields of Bliss, Ow!
S29E01_705#where the days are passed in frolic most joyous.
S29E01_708#Just frolicking? That's it?
S29E01_710#Sometimes, you wave ribbons through the air.
S29E01_713#But mainly, frolicking.
S29E01_714#Doesn't that get old?
S29E01_716#Did I mention the ribbons?
S29E01_717#'Cause there's ribbons.
S29E01_719#Fields of Bliss? Nonsense.
S29E01_721#The afterlife is an eternity of slaughtering
S29E01_723#and being slaughtered by your enemies.
S29E01_724#Oh, yeah.
S29E01_726#You're both wrong. After death,
S29E01_728#you spend all day counting Goblin Jesus's money.
S29E01_731#And it better all be there.
S29E01_733#71 mermaids.
S29E01_735#Some where the fish is the top part.
S29E01_736#Top.
S29E01_737#Mushrooms.
S29E01_739#Everywhere, mushrooms.
S29E01_741#Frolicking and ribbons!
S29E01_744#Yeah, but what if after we die, that's it?
S29E01_747#We're just gone?
S29E01_749#So just poof?
S29E01_752#Really? Poof, and then just super nothing?
S29E01_755#Well, it's clean. I'll give you that.
S29E01_763#Oh, yeah.
S29E01_765#This is way better than death.
S29E01_767#Come on, Mom.
S29E01_769#There's so many things we can say to each other now.
S29E01_771#Oh, really?
S29E01_773#Okay, then, say them.
S29E01_774#I'm waiting.
S29E01_778#Well...
S29E01_779#What about you guys?
S29E01_781#What do you want to ask your grandma?
S29E01_784#I got nothing. I'm gonna take a stroll
S29E01_786#and enjoy the golden age of cleavage.
S29E01_787#Lisa?
S29E01_791#Oh! Well, Grandma,
S29E01_793#tell us of your most a ardent swai.
S29E01_796#I dated a shape-shifter once.
S29E01_798#I thought I could keep him from changing.
S29E01_800#I was wrong.
S29E01_802#Love is a fairy tale!
S29E01_807#Every moment with her is a precious gift.
S29E01_810#Yes. Yes, it is.
S29E01_812#All that matters is that we're a family
S29E01_814#and we're together.
S29E01_823#Sorcerer-intendent Chalmers.
S29E01_826#Your daughter has been detected using witchcraft.
S29E01_829#Under the Magic: The Gathering Act,
S29E01_831#she is hereby property of the crown.
S29E01_834#What? My daughter isn't a magician.
S29E01_837#Oh, I'm terribly sorry, but she is.
S29E01_840#Yes, the moment that she transmuted lead into gold,
S29E01_843#our palantirs-- they just went bananas.
S29E01_845#I've never seen palantirs go so bananas.
S29E01_846#It was the only way.
S29E01_849#I just didn't want you to be sad about Grandma.
S29E01_852#Oh, no. This is all my fault.
S29E01_854#Don't blame yourself, honey.
S29E01_856#We're all at fault for doing whatever it takes
S29E01_858#to make you happy.
S29E01_860#?Help!
S29E01_861#You can't nap my kid!
S29E01_862#That's kidnapping!
S29E01_864#Toenail Imprisonum!
S29E01_869#Lisa's magic?
S29E01_871#Maybe I'm magic, too!
S29E01_875#Yeah, just grab a stick and say a funny word.
S29E01_877#Yeah, that's not insulting to us at all.
S29E01_879#Please don't take my daughter.
S29E01_881#She was only trying to save her grandmother.
S29E01_884#She sounds like a wonderful kid.
S29E01_886#Now please say good-bye to her forever.
S29E01_891#Take a peasant, leave a peasant.
S29E01_898#She's gone. Lisa's gone.
S29E01_902#Clip me out of here, Marge. I'm gonna rescue Lisa
S29E01_904#if I have to kill every noble in that castle.
S29E01_907#But Dad, serfs can't rise up against nobles.
S29E01_909#You'd be attacking the system itself.
S29E01_911#And nobody loves feudalism more than you.
S29E01_914#Son, feudalism is a beautiful vision.
S29E01_916#The Bill of No Rights.
S29E01_918#One person, no vote.
S29E01_921#But I'm willing to betray all that
S29E01_923#to get my daughter back.
S29E01_925#Hey, you mind if I dissolve those?
S29E01_927#Uh, just checking.
S29E01_929#Better to ask. Better to ask.
S29E01_932#Peasants, peons,
S29E01_934#and distinguished beggars!
S29E01_938#Aren't you tired of the nobles taking the wheat we sow,
S29E01_941#the yarn we spin,
S29E01_943#and the wine we steal
S29E01_945#from travelers we murder on the road?
S29E01_947#They even take our children.
S29E01_949#And not just the worthless Barts,
S29E01_951#but the magical Lisas.
S29E01_957#If we can put a moon-spangled hat on a man,
S29E01_960#why can't we kill a bunch of rich jerks
S29E01_963#and take their stuff?!
S29E01_979#How are we going to get over these walls?
S29E01_981#Walls...
S29E01_983#cannot stop us.
S29E01_986#The trees will fight with you.
S29E01_988#We will never forget your sacrifice.
S29E01_991#Sacrifice?
S29E01_994#We could have torn down
S29E01_997#the castle walls in five minutes.
S29E01_1001#Trees can't talk, silly.
S29E01_1015#Mom!
S29E01_1017#Dad! Help!
S29E01_1020#Milhouses, save your girlfriend!
S29E01_1022#Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!
S29E01_1024#Okay, no, um...
S29E01_1026#uh, just a friend who is a girl.
S29E01_1029#It's something to build on.
S29E01_1036#You peasants are a drag-on the economy.
S29E01_1039#Oh! I get it.
S29E01_1041#Because he's riding a dragon!
S29E01_1046#My love for wordplay is undiminished!
S29E01_1053#Oh, no! We're losing.
S29E01_1056#We need to talk.
S29E01_1058#- Now? ?- Yes, now.
S29E01_1060#It's time for me to... go.
S29E01_1062#?Life is about moving forward.
S29E01_1065#Girls want to be women, women want to be mothers,
S29E01_1068#mothers want to be grandmas,
S29E01_1070#and grandmas want to know what comes next.
S29E01_1073#But what if I'm not ready?
S29E01_1075#I wouldn't leave you if I didn't know you'll be all right.
S29E01_1081#Okay, Mom. I understand.
S29E01_1085#Maybe I was born a peasant,
S29E01_1087#but I'm going out an ice queen.
S29E01_1120#Now we won!
S29E01_1127#My mom gave her life to save ours.
S29E01_1130#Take comfort, Marge.
S29E01_1132#Now she's in the Fields of Bliss.
S29E01_1135#No, she's in Goblin Money Heaven.
S29E01_1137#The afterlife is snakes chewing your eyes,
S29E01_1139#but it feels good.
S29E01_1141#This is our heaven!
S29E01_1145#Or, as long as Grarama lives on in our hearts,
S29E01_1148#then she's never truly gone.
S29E01_1150#Until we die.
S29E01_1151#Then it's like she never existed.
S29E01_1153#And, someday, no one will remember you.
S29E01_1156#Or anybody.
S29E01_1159#All is well-- the nobles are defeated,
S29E01_1161#the dragon is dead,
S29E01_1162#and I've got a daughter
S29E01_1164#who can turn lead into gold!
S29E01_1167#Um, actually, I can't anymore.
S29E01_1170#Dragon fire is the source of all magic.
S29E01_1173#And Grandma killed the last one.
S29E01_1175#Everything wondrous and extraordinary about our world
S29E01_1177#is going to fade.
S29E01_1181#But maybe now we can use science to improve our world.
S29E01_1183#With new technologies,
S29E01_1185#we can put an end to poverty and disease.
S29E01_1188#Sure, it'll be hard work,
S29E01_1190#but far more rewarding than waving your hand
S29E01_1192#over a rock to change it into gold.
S29E01_1194#I mean...
S29E01_1196#Please come back, magic!
S29E01_1199#Live, damn you, live.
S29E01_1206#?I am risen!
S29E01_1207#But what about science?
S29E01_1210#Oh, sweetie, who would want to live in a world without magic?
S29E01_1213#It would be so boring.
S29E01_1215#People would have to make up fantasy stories...
S29E01_1218#Most of them poorly- written pretenses
S29E01_1220#for explicit sex and violence.
S29E01_1222#...just to escape the tedious real world.
S29E01_1225#That does sound awful.
S29E01_1227#Look! The dragon is burning our village.
S29E01_1231#I love our life.
S29E02_25#34, 35...
S29E02_27#37?
S29E02_28#No!
S29E02_30#Oh, I have to go all the way around again.
S29E02_40#I had the locker dream again.
S29E02_43#Oh, honey, that's four nights in a row.
S29E02_45#Stupid recurring dreams.
S29E02_47#Why can't brains come up with something new?
S29E02_49#That's why they're losing viewers to Netflix.
S29E02_52#Maybe I should talk to a therapist.
S29E02_55#Sweetie, our insurance won't pay for any more sessions.
S29E02_58#Your father used them all up on grief counseling
S29E02_61#after the Halloween candy ran out.
S29E02_63#I've come to accept that we were lucky to have it
S29E02_65#while we did.
S29E02_67#But I know a cheap place where you can see
S29E02_69#the therapists of tomorrow today.
S29E02_71#Behold, Springfield Community College,
S29E02_74#where the students practice... on you!
S29E02_78#I only paid a student dentist $12 for this brand-new crown.
S29E02_81#See?
S29E02_82#I don't think it's supposed to come out.
S29E02_84#That's why I paid a student paralegal to sue him.
S29E02_86#I lost!
S29E02_95#Yarr! Yarr.
S29E02_99#TV must be a circle!
S29E02_104#Give him the full flea dip and deluxe under-worming.
S29E02_106#I'm not a dog.
S29E02_107#And I've been worm-free for two weeks!
S29E02_109#You better muzzle him. He's a biter.
S29E02_113#My name is Annette, and I'm a therapist-in-training.
S29E02_116#I'm also a mother-to-be,
S29E02_117#so I know there's nothing more beautiful
S29E02_119#than a child's feelings.
S29E02_121#You sound so caring and professional.
S29E02_124#When do I give you the seven dollars?
S29E02_126#There's a shoebox by the door.
S29E02_129#So what does my locker dream mean?
S29E02_130#Am I stressed about school?
S29E02_132#I mean, schools are full of lockers.
S29E02_134#Hey, who's the almost-therapist here?
S29E02_151#You know, I think you might benefit from art therapy.
S29E02_155#Draw in these empty panels
S29E02_157#to tell the story of a typical day
S29E02_159#in the life of you, Sophia Barnum.
S29E02_162#Once again, learn the patient's name.
S29E02_164#Sorry, Professor.
S29E02_166#Lisa Simpson.
S29E02_168#Excellent. Continue.
S29E02_170#Your light's still on.
S29E02_173#Art therapy.
S29E02_175#Okay, draw a typical day.
S29E02_183#Horrible!
S29E02_184#It looks like it was drawn by an eight-year-old!
S29E02_194#Oh, boy, I can't wait to take you to the park.
S29E02_197#The other owners will be so jealous.
S29E02_199#You're not my owner.
S29E02_201#Uh, I kinda am.
S29E02_218#I'm hearing a lot of feelings in here.
S29E02_221#You're hearing them because I am not drawing them!
S29E02_224#Aw, sweetie, drawing is tricky.
S29E02_227#But you just need to start with something simple, like people.
S29E02_229#Those are people.
S29E02_234#It's easy, honey.
S29E02_239#Add some eyelashes here,
S29E02_241#some crosshatching to show shadow,
S29E02_244#vary the line width here to accent the outline,
S29E02_246#and voil¨¤!
S29E02_248#That's great!
S29E02_250#Now in the next panel,
S29E02_251#I want her to be looking out a window,
S29E02_253#wondering if she'll ever get out
S29E02_255#from under the weight of her own expectations.
S29E02_258#Well, I could make the eyebrows come down in a "V."
S29E02_261#That says it all.
S29E02_265#Hey, Mom, what if I told you the things I was feeling
S29E02_268#and you drew them?
S29E02_269#Okay. But I'm warning you,
S29E02_271#I'm not good at drawing turtle feet.
S29E02_273#So if there are any turtles in this,
S29E02_275#they're gonna be wearing sneakers.
S29E02_276#Deal.
S29E02_278#It starts with the story of a regular day...
S29E02_323#Gosh, I forgot how hard school can be 
S29E02_325#for a sensitive kid.
S29E02_326#It's miserable.
S29E02_328#But you captured my feelings perfectly!
S29E02_333#Annette, wait till you see my art therapy!
S29E02_335#You're gonna love it, too.
S29E02_337#Please try to pretend I'm not here.
S29E02_339#Okay, Stephen.
S29E02_342#Hey, where did it go?
S29E02_344#Best marriage counseling ever.
S29E02_347#But we still need to discuss
S29E02_349#your addiction to unboxing videos.
S29E02_352#Do not make me choose between you and unboxing.
S29E02_359#Manga!
S29E02_368#It's been a week, and I still can't find my therapy comic.
S29E02_370#I'd be just mortified
S29E02_373#if even one person saw my private thoughts...
S29E02_378#Mom, can I have permission to swear?
S29E02_380#Okay, as long as it's a tier one.
S29E02_382#Damn it!
S29E02_383#That didn't work.
S29E02_384#Can I go to tier two?
S29E02_386#- I'm afraid not. - Damn it!
S29E02_391#And with that seal cut,
S29E02_393#we have completed the unboxing of the outer shipping plastic.
S29E02_396#Indeed we have.
S29E02_401#You published my private art therapy as a comic book?
S29E02_404#Um, actually, it's a graphic novel.
S29E02_405#The distinctions are threefold...
S29E02_407#- Shut up! - Okay then.
S29E02_409#Um, in my defense, my wife did it.
S29E02_411#Kumiko, how could you?
S29E02_413#I have acted shamefully.
S29E02_415#I must commit furry cosplay.
S29E02_421#There's nothing sexy about shame!
S29E02_423#Except in my native Japan, where it's our whole thing.
S29E02_426#Mr. And Mrs. Book Guy, you had no right to do this!
S29E02_429#These are my daughter's feelings.
S29E02_431#And my doodles.
S29E02_432#I shall burn them on a pyre
S29E02_434#and disperse them to the seven winds.
S29E02_436#That's all I ask.
S29E02_441#One Sad Girl, please.
S29E02_442#Sad Girl's the best!
S29E02_444#It's tragically delicious!
S29E02_446#Wait!
S29E02_448#Maybe this isn't so bad.
S29E02_452#My Lulus!
S29E02_463#Ooh, there she is.
S29E02_464#Ask for her autograph.
S29E02_465#You ask her, man.
S29E02_466#I'm freakin' out.
S29E02_469#Wow, Lisa, our cartoon book seems to have really captured the...
S29E02_472#What's that word I'm looking for?
S29E02_474#Zeitgeist!
S29E02_475#Oh, hi, Mel!
S29E02_477#Say hi to Barbara for me.
S29E02_479#I'm not your messenger boy!
S29E02_484#What's so great about graphic novels?
S29E02_486#They're just comic books with no superheroes
S29E02_489#and no cool sound effects like "Thwam!, ack-ack-ack-ack!",
S29E02_492#- and "fwwwip!" - Snag!
S29E02_494#Lisa, Kumiko called.
S29E02_496#She sold all her copies and wants us to make a sequel!
S29E02_500#That's like a prequel but in the future.
S29E02_502#What do you say, sweetie?
S29E02_504#Do you have more sad in you?
S29E02_506#I've got scads of sad!
S29E02_509#*Oh, no, not again*
S29E02_513#*There they go with pad and pen*
S29E02_517#*Collaboration*
S29E02_521#*Ooh, collaboration*
S29E02_525#*Collaboration*
S29E02_528#*Collaboration.*
S29E02_531#Okay, now draw me overhearing the other girls
S29E02_534#talking about how they're not gonna invite me
S29E02_535#to a birthday party.
S29E02_537#Like this?
S29E02_538#Fantastic!
S29E02_540#Now let's take a little break.
S29E02_541#And you know what that means.
S29E02_543#Hot Sharpie!
S29E02_545#Hot Sharpie!
S29E02_546#- Hot Sharpie! - Hot Sharpie!
S29E02_547#- Hot Sharpie! - Hot Sharpie!
S29E02_549#You almost got me! 
S29E02_550#How come we never bond like that?
S29E02_552#I don't know, you never make the first move.
S29E02_554#Okay.
S29E02_556#There is something I've always wanted to do with you.
S29E02_564#Hey, those guys stole our fishing poles!
S29E02_566#And my skipping stones!
S29E02_587#Welcome to "Chicks with Pix,"
S29E02_589#a panel discussion with women writers and artists.
S29E02_592#I'm your moderator, Roz Chast.
S29E02_594#You may know my New Yorker cartoons
S29E02_596#that are both funny ha-ha and funny aha.
S29E02_600#Silence!
S29E02_603#Joining me today are Alison Bechdel;
S29E02_605#Marjane Satrapi;
S29E02_607#and the creators of Sad Girl, Lisa Simpson...
S29E02_612#We love you, Lisa!
S29E02_614#...and Marge Simpson.
S29E02_617#We're wasting time!
S29E02_620#Marjane, as the author of Persepolis
S29E02_622#and someone who grew up in a repressive regime,
S29E02_624#what advice would you offer to young women?
S29E02_626#Always remember nothing is more valuable
S29E02_628#than your own unique voice.
S29E02_630#Also, when they promise you 
S29E02_631#a tote bag for doing a panel,
S29E02_633#make sure it's not just a reusable grocery bag.
S29E02_635#Look at this.
S29E02_638#Alison Bechdel, recently,
S29E02_640#a lot of people have been talking about the Bechdel Test.
S29E02_643#Exactly what kind of drinking game is that?
S29E02_645#Actually, it's just an observation I made
S29E02_647#about how movies and TV rarely show
S29E02_649#two women talking about something other than a man.
S29E02_652#That's so interesting.
S29E02_654#I'll have to tell my husband about that.
S29E02_659#Bechdel Test: Fail!
S29E02_661#*Bechdel, Bechdel *
S29E02_663#*Bechdel, fail!*
S29E02_665#*Fail!*
S29E02_666#*Fail.*
S29E02_669#Okay. We have five minutes before we have to clear the room
S29E02_672#for the "White Men in Comics" panel.
S29E02_674#I have a question for Lisa.
S29E02_676#I have a question for Lisa with a follow-up for Lisa.
S29E02_679#I want to talk about myself for a few minutes,
S29E02_681#then at the end, pretend it was all a question for Lisa.
S29E02_684#Does anyone have any questions for my mom?
S29E02_686#She does draw every panel.
S29E02_688#Yeah, I have a question for Marge.
S29E02_691#How lucky are you to work with Lisa?
S29E02_692#Lisa!
S29E02_694#Lisa! Lisa!
S29E02_696#Lisa win!
S29E02_698#Marge fail.
S29E02_704#Honey, I was thinking.
S29E02_706#What if we did a chapter from the mom's point of view?
S29E02_709#I took a stab at writing it up. Give it a read.
S29E02_711#In front of you?
S29E02_713#Okay.
S29E02_720#What are you laughing at?
S29E02_722#You left out a word here,
S29E02_724#so it just says, "I lonely."
S29E02_728#So should I start drawing it?
S29E02_730#Well, there's a lot of great stuff here.
S29E02_733#Really? Because that's what I was going for.
S29E02_736#But I'm not sure this is a Sad Girl thing.
S29E02_739#Maybe it's a separate book
S29E02_741#and I could write the forward.
S29E02_742#Oh, I get it.
S29E02_744#This isn't a real collaboration at all.
S29E02_747#You agree with those girl fanboys.
S29E02_749#You think it's all about you.
S29E02_751#Hey, you can't blame me
S29E02_753#if people want to focus on my contribution.
S29E02_755#I can and I do.
S29E02_758#I hate to say it, Mom,
S29E02_760#but maybe we should take a break.
S29E02_763#Good idea. Hot Sharpie.
S29E02_768#No. I mean, maybe we should take a real break.
S29E02_771#- You mean... ? - That's right.
S29E02_773#I want to see other illustrators.
S29E02_777#- I don't even know how you could say that. - Stupid Lisa.
S29E02_778#- It's my vision. - She's acting like a real B.
S29E02_780#Ladies, there's someone here to see you.
S29E02_785#My name is Guthrie Frenel,
S29E02_787#visionary theatrical director and impish genius.
S29E02_790#And I want to make Sad Girl into 
S29E02_792#a smash Broadway show.
S29E02_795#I think he came in through the window.
S29E02_797#Oh, tubby, you're a delight.
S29E02_801#You want to make Sad Girl into a stage musical?
S29E02_805#If I may borrow a phrase from my father, woo-hoo!
S29E02_808#This is all very exciting,
S29E02_809#but before we go any further
S29E02_811#and I ask this just for clarification
S29E02_814#- what's your deal, weirdo? - Dad.
S29E02_816#Guthrie Frenel is a visionary director and an impish genius.
S29E02_819#He did a version of Waiting for Godot
S29E02_822#- where Godot appears in the first scene. -What?
S29E02_825#And that was nothing compared to my vision for Sad Girl.
S29E02_828#I want to do something new and amazing,
S29E02_830#like my all-dog version of Cats.
S29E02_832#But I need something from you.
S29E02_834#- Anything. - I need your passion.
S29E02_836#I need your joy.
S29E02_838#Are we all together for this three-person toboggan ride
S29E02_841#down Mount Collabor-manjaro?
S29E02_844#Well, Lisa and I did just have a little spat.
S29E02_848#Yeah, but conflict is part of the creative process, right?
S29E02_850#Not in my experience!
S29E02_852#So are you in?
S29E02_854#- Yes. - Absolutely.
S29E02_858#Oh, this is gonna take hours.
S29E02_863#Bart, there's one thing I know about Broadway shows,
S29E02_865#they always make money.
S29E02_867#So I'm already looking forward to quitting my job.
S29E02_869#Can I quit school?
S29E02_871#I'd be a pretty lousy dad if I said no.
S29E02_875#It's our duty as artists
S29E02_878#to rip up the contract between audience and performers.
S29E02_881#Cell phones will be turned on.
S29E02_883#Candy will be unwrapped during the show.
S29E02_885#We'll hire performance artists
S29E02_887#to make the line for the ladies room extra long.
S29E02_892#Um, how closely are we gonna stick
S29E02_894#to the story from my graphic novel?
S29E02_896#Oh, yes, story.
S29E02_898#All the gimmicky stagecraft in the world
S29E02_899#ain't worth a tinker's damn
S29E02_901#without a compelling human story at the center.
S29E02_904#Your story, the unique expression
S29E02_906#of your heart and soul...
S29E02_908#...will be neatly summed up
S29E02_910#in the narrator's first speech.
S29E02_912#Once that's out of the way,
S29E02_914#we can explore the dazzling
S29E02_916#visual buffet of Marge Simpson.
S29E02_918#Now feast.
S29E02_921#Pass the wonderment, please,
S29E02_923#but save room for the Tonys.
S29E02_925#Oh, my God.
S29E02_927#It's just how I drew it.
S29E02_929#It's your artistic vision writ large.
S29E02_932#Or should I say, writ Marge?
S29E02_933#You should.
S29E02_934#He really shouldn't.
S29E02_940#It's all in my style.
S29E02_945#Mom, he's ignoring my story
S29E02_947#and making this all about your drawings.
S29E02_950#I know.
S29E02_952#I'm sorry, Lisa.
S29E02_954#But I can't help it if he wants to focus
S29E02_955#on the visual part of--
S29E02_958#Oh, my God. It's Bart and Grampa.
S29E02_961#But they aren't even in my book.
S29E02_963#And where am I? Where is Sad Girl?
S29E02_965#Sad Girl will be represented

S29E02_969#an empty seat in the balcony. Bold, no?
S29E02_972#But how will they know it's supposed to be me?
S29E02_974#Storytelling.
S29E02_979#That impish genius is really cheesing me off.
S29E02_982#All he's kept from Sad Girl is Mom's drawings,
S29E02_986#when it's supposed to be about my writing and my feelings.
S29E02_989#Oh, I'm so sick of children's feelings.
S29E02_991#"Feed me." "Burp me."
S29E02_993#"Don't sleep for six years."
S29E02_994#You're forgetting the boundary
S29E02_996#between patient and therapist.
S29E02_998#And you're forgetting that you did this to me!
S29E02_1002#Let me tell you something, Lisa.
S29E02_1004#When you give birth to something,
S29E02_1006#you have no control over what it turns into.
S29E02_1008#All you can do is surrender to the nightmare.
S29E02_1012#Sorry. I'm just so happy.
S29E02_1019#Never do this.
S29E02_1021#Here they are.
S29E02_1024#The official Sad Girl: The Theater Experience T-shirts.
S29E02_1028#$45 in the lobby, of which we keep $1.35.
S29E02_1032#Oh, baby, we can use that money to buy a sailboat
S29E02_1035#with a double-ended spinnaker pole.
S29E02_1039#Looks good. I like it.
S29E02_1040#I like everything.
S29E02_1042#Really? You seemed a little cheesed off earlier.
S29E02_1045#A mother notices.
S29E02_1047#Mom, Sad Girl was like our baby.
S29E02_1049#And you can't control what your kid turns into.
S29E02_1052#If it becomes a successful show,
S29E02_1054#that'll be good for our family.
S29E02_1055#Now if you'll excuse me,
S29E02_1057#I'm gonna go sit on a swing alone.
S29E02_1059#Oh, okay. 
S29E02_1061#Hello, Coast Guard?
S29E02_1063#Get ready to search for my body in about a month.
S29E02_1072#- So you're okay with this? - Sure.
S29E02_1075#It's an honor to have something based on your life.
S29E02_1077#Even if it's nothing like your life at all.
S29E02_1083#*Sad Girl*
S29E02_1101#What the hell does any of this mean?
S29E02_1103#What? You don't get this?
S29E02_1105#It's so stimulating and I love it.
S29E02_1110#What is that?!
S29E02_1133#Uh, Guthrie, is it possible 
S29E02_1136#we strayed a skoosh too far from what Lisa's book is about?
S29E02_1139#Marge, this isn't You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown.
S29E02_1142#Or even my production of You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown,
S29E02_1145#set in a doomed Soviet submarine.
S29E02_1147#This is avant-garde theater, and it is electric.
S29E02_1153#Okay, I guess.
S29E02_1164#Oh, Lisa.
S29E02_1166#I'm so sorry. 
S29E02_1171#There, honey. Now you're back in our show.
S29E02_1176#What the... ? That's not one of my brain babies.
S29E02_1191#Which one of us is me?
S29E02_1202#Run for your cultural lives!
S29E02_1204#I'm haunted my visions of Milhouse.
S29E02_1218#And now to read the reviews.
S29E02_1220#"Greatest..." I like where this is going.
S29E02_1222#"...disaster in theater history."
S29E02_1224#Oh, those sons of Bs.
S29E02_1228#Honey, I'm sorry I let Guthrie make the play
S29E02_1231#all about my drawings, and also terrible.
S29E02_1235#And I'm sorry I wasn't more open to your creative input.
S29E02_1238#I blame both of you for this disaster.
S29E02_1239#More wine!
S29E02_1241#I've got another project
S29E02_1242#for us to collaborate on.
S29E02_1244#Getting your dad in a cab.
S29E02_1247#Hello, Coast Guard? I'm gonna live.
S29E02_1280#I still think it's good.
S29E03_65#Homer. 
S29E03_67#- Homer. - Huh? What?
S29E03_68#I'll be right home.
S29E03_69#You are home.
S29E03_72#Homer.
S29E03_74#Homer, wake up, please.
S29E03_75#I can't sleep.
S29E03_77#I'm having friends over tomorrow.
S29E03_79#- Luann Van Houten. - Back-stabber.
S29E03_81#- Bernice Hibbert. - Snob.
S29E03_83#And Helen Lovejoy.
S29E03_84#Okay, she's pretty hot.
S29E03_86#I mean, hot for a reverend's wife,
S29E03_88#but so judgmental.
S29E03_91#I was going to ask you if you could watch Maggie.
S29E03_93#Oh, yeah, of course.
S29E03_94#What do you suspect?
S29E03_98#Isn't this great?
S29E03_100#Daddy-baby alone time.
S29E03_102#Where's Daddy? Peek-a-boo.
S29E03_106#Where's Daddy? Peek-a-boo.
S29E03_109#Where's Daddy? Peek-a-boo.
S29E03_111#Where's Daddy? Peek-a-boo.
S29E03_113#Where's Daddy? Peek-a-boo.
S29E03_115#Oh, you're sick of it already?
S29E03_117#I was gonna do different people.
S29E03_119#Peek-a-boo-ooh!
S29E03_122#I'm afraid, Master Wayne,
S29E03_124#it's time for peek-a-boo.
S29E03_125#Ah, come on. Nothing?
S29E03_127#Babies love Michael Caine.
S29E03_130#What to do? What to do?
S29E03_133#What to... do.
S29E03_136#What... to... do.
S29E03_139#Mags, I'll level with you.
S29E03_140#I love you, kiddo,
S29E03_142#but we are in two completely different worlds.
S29E03_151#More lemonade, ladies?
S29E03_152#No, thank you.
S29E03_154#I've had better lemonade at Ralph Wiggum's stand.
S29E03_157#And he stirs it with his finger.
S29E03_163#So we've been asked to redecorate the school room
S29E03_166#where the kids wait when their ride is late.
S29E03_167#I have some ideas.
S29E03_169#Marge, you have many wonderful talents,
S29E03_172#but your sense of style is, uh...
S29E03_174#- One of them? - I'm afraid not.
S29E03_176#Purple and orange cupboards,
S29E03_178#oh, corncob curtains,
S29E03_180#rabbit ears on the TV.
S29E03_182#It's like we're visiting the Flintstones.
S29E03_186#Well, since you don't like my style,
S29E03_188#maybe I should show you the door.
S29E03_190#You mean the brown door next to the hot pink walls.
S29E03_193#Just like at the circus.
S29E03_195#Well, an elephant does live here.
S29E03_197#An elephant?
S29E03_199#You're calling my husband an elephant?
S29E03_201#Marge, we got any more peanuts?
S29E03_204#Oh, Homer.
S29E03_208#No.
S29E03_212#What the... ?
S29E03_215#Is it that bird?
S29E03_220#- Marge! Are you making tea? - Yes.
S29E03_223#Iced tea.
S29E03_225#What the hell?
S29E03_228#This is WHIS.
S29E03_230#Whistling at you all day and night.
S29E03_232#WHIS, The Whistle.
S29E03_234#Ah. Whistling format radio.
S29E03_241#Where is that whistling coming from?
S29E03_245#Maggie?
S29E03_251#It is you!
S29E03_253#It's so odd-- I'm a terrible whistler.
S29E03_255#Always have been. 
S29E03_258#There must be a reason you were given this gift.
S29E03_262#It's to make people think I can whistle.
S29E03_268#Homer! Homer! Homer!
S29E03_271#And now I will perform
S29E03_273#"Flight of the Bumblebee."
S29E03_290#Who was that president?
S29E03_292#He looked pretty generic.
S29E03_298#I do too have taste.
S29E03_299#I'm afraid not.
S29E03_302#Corncob curtains.
S29E03_304#Mom, what's wrong?
S29E03_306#Why aren't you answering me?
S29E03_307#I'm right here.
S29E03_309#Honey, I'm just feeling sorry for myself,
S29E03_311#but I'll show them.
S29E03_314#I'll make a late pickup room like that school has never seen.
S29E03_317#That'll be easy, there's never been one.
S29E03_355#Well, what do you think of my late pickup room?
S29E03_358#It's wonderful. Hard to believe
S29E03_360#it's the same room they found all those dead rats in.
S29E03_364#Well, maybe you can fool the Hibberts,
S29E03_366#but to me, this is the work of a...
S29E03_367#Genius.
S29E03_369#Salud.
S29E03_372#Well, gee.
S29E03_374#Guess who got a job today.
S29E03_375#- You? - Nope.
S29E03_377#The guy who went in after me.
S29E03_379#I-I totally set him up.
S29E03_382#Listen, I recently purchased the old post office to renovate.
S29E03_386#Would you like to be my interior decorator?
S29E03_389#Well, ladies.
S29E03_391#Looks like someone appreciates me--
S29E03_393#the one man in town who trims his nails.
S29E03_396#Is one of them giving you trouble?
S29E03_399#There's no room in the trunk, boss.
S29E03_400#- Bodies? - No.
S29E03_402#Bottled water and toilet paper, remember?
S29E03_404#We made that Costco run.
S29E03_408#Now do it backwards.
S29E03_411#Now sideways.
S29E03_413#Hey, come on. She's just a baby.
S29E03_414#Who is?
S29E03_415#Uh, my talent.
S29E03_416#Makes sense.
S29E03_418#Well, well, well.
S29E03_421#Seems like my no-talent son can suddenly whistle.
S29E03_424#Tell me, Homer, how'd you trill that high "C"
S29E03_427#with your lips in second position?
S29E03_434#Oh, it's amazing.
S29E03_442#She's got my whistling gene, all right.
S29E03_444#Which, unfortunately, skips a generation.
S29E03_447#I hope it works out better for you than it did for me.
S29E03_450#I was booked on the top whistling show on radio,
S29E03_453#Your Blow of Blows, with Sid Wheezer.
S29E03_459#Good evening, folks. Sid Wheezer here,
S29E03_461#sipping a delicious Buzz Cola.
S29E03_466#Ah, refreshing.
S29E03_468#Keep polio at bay, the Buzz Cola way.
S29E03_471#Oh, thanks a lot.
S29E03_473#Our next act is a swell kid
S29E03_474#from right here in Springfield.
S29E03_476#His hobby is straightening elbow macaroni.
S29E03_479#Let's here it for Little Abraham Simpson.
S29E03_484#Then I got cocky.
S29E03_487#Tried a little stunt called the Triple Windy.
S29E03_501#Blew out the ligaments in my lips.
S29E03_503#Had to hire guys to kiss my girlfriend.
S29E03_505#It was a good deal.
S29E03_506#I'd pay for five minutes,
S29E03_508#but it would go on for hours.
S29E03_511#When the time was right,
S29E03_512#I'd make my move.
S29E03_519#But this little magpie, she's got my gift.
S29E03_522#And now she's going into showbiz.
S29E03_524#Couldn't showbiz screw her up?
S29E03_526#You know, like it did Ron Howard?
S29E03_528#He hasn't won an Oscar since 2002.
S29E03_531#Oh, please, son, do this for me.
S29E03_534#Dad, you should not live your life through your granddaughter.
S29E03_548#You poor guy. She'll do it.
S29E03_558#Okay, Maggie. Time to learn a happy tune
S29E03_561#from these imprisoned birds.
S29E03_566#Man, Maggie's talented, Lisa's talented.
S29E03_568#What am I good at?
S29E03_569#The birds love ya.
S29E03_571#Well, yeah, but they also love Grampa.
S29E03_576#Go ahead, but my blood's turned to bile
S29E03_578#from watching Fox News.
S29E03_585#This is my new property,
S29E03_587#the original Springfield Post Office,
S29E03_590#jewel of the implosion district.
S29E03_596#You'll get used to that.
S29E03_598#We'll definitely want to try to keep the original facade.
S29E03_601#Yes, indeed.
S29E03_603#I'm all about keeping up facades.
S29E03_605#Is it okay if I take some foundation measurements?
S29E03_607#Of course.
S29E03_609#In case she sees something she shouldn't,
S29E03_611#have a hood ready.
S29E03_617#Idiota! You whack who you shouldn't,
S29E03_620#and you don't whack who you should.
S29E03_622#Is this about your brother again?
S29E03_633#You're gonna love this baby!
S29E03_635#- She whistles! - This I gotta hear--
S29E03_637#not because I am looking forward to it,
S29E03_638#but because it is my job.
S29E03_646#Fantastic talent!
S29E03_648#Now, move along-- I have a heart attack at 4:00.
S29E03_650#And... here it comes.
S29E03_652#Oy vey!
S29E03_659#You sit on it, you bought it.
S29E03_660#Due!
S29E03_665#Can you picture this water feature
S29E03_667#at the back wall of the foyer?
S29E03_669#My sainted mother shared your gift.
S29E03_671#Where others saw only an empty Chianti bottle,
S29E03_674#she saw a candleholder.
S29E03_677#We would have to rip out some walls.
S29E03_679#- Done. - You won't be seeing those walls no more.
S29E03_682#Why do these guys come with us for everything?
S29E03_685#Have you noticed how we are not dead?
S29E03_687#That is mostly due to them.
S29E03_689#Give the wall job to the Palermo brothers.
S29E03_692#Tell them to make it look like an accident.
S29E03_694#We'll make that wall dig its own grave.
S29E03_703#What's that whistling?
S29E03_705#You know what they say-- in a marriage,
S29E03_707#don't ask a question you don't know the answer to.
S29E03_710#- That's what they say to defense attorneys. -Marge,
S29E03_713#how would you feel if I kept a big secret from you?
S29E03_716#How would you feel if I kept a big secret from you?
S29E03_720#- Good night. - Good night.
S29E03_730#Maggie, you can whistle?
S29E03_734#You're gifted, too!
S29E03_736#Maybe more gifted!
S29E03_738#No, no, I will not get caught in that trap
S29E03_741#that only one of us is good.
S29E03_743#We could both be good, like the South Park guys.
S29E03_745#Except Trey does everything.
S29E03_747#Trey does everything!
S29E03_753#Diva.
S29E03_756#This little piggy went to Broadway.
S29E03_758#This little piggy worked with Stallone.
S29E03_761#This little piggy got a Showtime special!
S29E03_766#I'm a great father.
S29E03_768#Tonight on Hollywood Nightmares,
S29E03_771#- What?! - ...child stars, prison bars.
S29E03_775#At three months old, Skyler Green could already patty-cake.
S29E03_778#By age one, she was the opening act
S29E03_780#for Frank Sinatra Jr. Jr. III.
S29E03_785#But after a disastrous Super Bowl halftime show
S29E03_788#that left Jacksonville's EverBank Field in ruins,
S29E03_791#Skyler's life would spin out of control.
S29E03_793#She began a downward spiral,
S29E03_795#woke up too many mornings with stuffed animals
S29E03_797#whose names she didn't know,
S29E03_799#and she was arrested twice for former cuteness,
S29E03_801#under the Scott Baio Law.
S29E03_803#Patty-cake, patty-cake, baker's man,
S29E03_806#bake me a train wreck just as fast as you can.
S29E03_809#Oh, my God. Am I doing this for you,
S29E03_812#or because it makes me feel good?
S29E03_816#A showbiz kiss!
S29E03_819#There's nothing more sincere than that. We'll do it!
S29E03_830#Marge, I love what you've done here.
S29E03_832#It's as much "Mwah!"
S29E03_834#as it is "Ey! Whoa!"
S29E03_837#It certainly was a challenge-- so many bedrooms.
S29E03_840#You must be expecting a lot of sleepover guests.
S29E03_842#Is she, er, uh, one of the, uh...?
S29E03_845#No, no. She's the decorator.
S29E03_847#But I can get one like her.
S29E03_849#Add it to my customer profile.
S29E03_851#Er, uh, yes.
S29E03_853#Dim lighting,
S29E03_855#honky-tonk piano...
S29E03_857#Anthony D'Amico,
S29E03_859#what is the repute of this house?
S29E03_861#Ill.
S29E03_863#Our top story-- you didn't see me.
S29E03_865#This is...
S29E03_867#John Doe saying "Good night."
S29E03_875#Why is everyone being so weird? Did the principal call?
S29E03_878#'Cause he's got nothing to call about.
S29E03_883#I can't keep this mountain lion in my bedroom forever, Bart.
S29E03_886#Just four more days.
S29E03_890#So listen, uh, I'm gonna take Maggie out for a walk.
S29E03_896#These spray-on boas are such a time-saver.
S29E03_903#Oh, God, that's good.
S29E03_907#Seems like everybody's got a secret but us, huh, guys?
S29E03_915#Tonight, see Maggie Simpson,
S29E03_916#the Unborn Comic,
S29E03_917#The Umbilical Chords
S29E03_919#and the Pixie Chicks.
S29E03_921#And now your host,
S29E03_923#Sedgwick the Personality!
S29E03_925#Welcome to whatever this is.
S29E03_927#Now, let's meet our judges.
S29E03_930#NBA star and host of Flip That Igloo,
S29E03_933#Muk Mu!
S29E03_935#Peace.
S29E03_936#Former Hot Tots champion,
S29E03_939#Baby Dimples Riskind!
S29E03_942#And robotic-themed DJ Der Zip-Zorp!
S29E03_951#You had lunch, didn't you?
S29E03_953#I gave you a 2:00 a.m. Curfew for a reason!
S29E03_955#Shut up!
S29E03_957#Where's denial when you need it?
S29E03_959#Maggie, this is no place for you.
S29E03_961#I'm taking you where you can be a kid again-- Moe's.
S29E03_970#Oh, I've created a monster!
S29E03_973#I've placated a monster!
S29E03_978#Marge Simpson, are the rumors true?
S29E03_981#Did you corncob a cathouse?
S29E03_983#It's not that.
S29E03_986#I sure love that new whorehouse smell.
S29E03_989#Marge, I never thought someone could sink this town lower,
S29E03_992#but you have.
S29E03_994#You lied to me!
S29E03_996#You may scare these guys,
S29E03_998#but to me, you're just a big fat liar!
S29E03_1001#Whoa. Nobody calls Fat Tony fat!
S29E03_1002#Nobody!
S29E03_1003#In the old country,
S29E03_1005#only two were allowed to speak truth to the Don--
S29E03_1009#his capo and his interior decorator.
S29E03_1011#You are lucky.
S29E03_1013#Now, please leave.
S29E03_1015#The launch party is tonight.
S29E03_1017#The Grey Goose people are bringing a big ice thing.
S29E03_1020#Well, Anthony, not knowing what I was designing for,
S29E03_1023#there's something I didn't tell you.
S29E03_1025#Your mother had a post office box
S29E03_1028#at this office.
S29E03_1030#I don't know whether to believe you.
S29E03_1038#Oh, looks like a letter from the pope.
S29E03_1046#You have surrounded a blessed letter to your mother
S29E03_1048#with a bordello!
S29E03_1051#That's it! Shut it down!
S29E03_1053#Apologize to our dear friends at Grey Goose.
S29E03_1057#So, what are you going to do with my work?
S29E03_1059#A little "Italian lightning" for insurance purposes.
S29E03_1063#And that is the last question of yours we will ever answer.
S29E03_1066#Good-bye, Mrs. Simpson.
S29E03_1069#Can't you at least wait until I'm out of the building?
S29E03_1072#I'm sorry, I get nervous, I do dumb things.
S29E03_1074#Maybe it's because I'm wearing a wire.
S29E03_1079#Now, put your hands together for the one who's going to win.
S29E03_1081#Whoops. That's supposed to be a secret.
S29E03_1083#Nothing I can do-- in one moment,
S29E03_1086#Maggie will stop being my little baby and belong to the world.
S29E03_1089#I remember her when she was just a bit of bad news.
S29E03_1093#Time for the greatest glory there is... reflected.
S29E03_1104#Oh, come on, I'm cheating on my wife to see this?
S29E03_1109#Look! She's got a tooth coming in!
S29E03_1111#That's the kiss of death for a whistler.
S29E03_1113#Give me a string and a doorknob!
S29E03_1116#That baby is naught but an overly dramatic,
S29E03_1119#boring windbag!
S29E03_1121#A windbag that yields no succor!
S29E03_1124#In sum, a nothing!
S29E03_1130#What? They're booing my Maggie?
S29E03_1132#This is the sweetest little girl in the world.
S29E03_1135#Nice try, but no hook can fit me.
S29E03_1141#This little angel never makes a fuss.
S29E03_1143#She always shares her baby food,
S29E03_1145#and she makes even a despicable show like this seem sweet!
S29E03_1148#Hey, pal, this is a talent show for babies.
S29E03_1150#We ain't goin' for sweet.
S29E03_1156#The only thing that's been worth it about this experience
S29E03_1160#is that I got to spend time with this little girl.
S29E03_1163#And that's the tooth!
S29E03_1166#Good night, my little star.
S29E03_1168#And if you have another amazing talent,
S29E03_1170#for the love of God, don't tell anybody.
S29E03_1173#Nighty-night.
S29E03_1181#Okay, so I'll never enter Maggie into another contest
S29E03_1183#without telling you, 
S29E03_1186#and you'll never design another sex palace for the Mob.
S29E03_1189#Agreed. No more secrets from each other.
S29E03_1193#No more secrets.
S29E03_1199#Are you letting my pants?
S29E03_1201#I'm afraid so.
S29E03_1203#I'm not a really size 32.
S29E04_10#I'm scared, Mom.
S29E04_12#What if they take me?
S29E04_14#Don't worry, Barterfinger.
S29E04_15#You're always the last.
S29E04_18#Even boxes of stale raisins go before you, Butterfinger...
S29E04_21#I mean, Barterfinger.
S29E04_24#No one ever wants the apple.
S29E04_26#They must be afraid there's a razor blade in me.
S29E04_29#Yeah. That's the reason.
S29E04_31#Maybe you'll be dipped in caramel.
S29E04_34#Oh, whoop-dee-doo.
S29E04_36#What the... Where am I going?
S29E04_38#You're going to heaven, Dad.
S29E04_41#Those pearly gates look a lot like teeth!
S29E04_43#Change is always hard.
S29E04_45#Well, I guess that...
S29E04_49#Cigarette breath!
S29E04_54#Oh, thank God.
S29E04_56#We made it through the night.
S29E04_61#And now you're on a high shelf,
S29E04_64#where they'll forget about you forever!
S29E04_68#Why won't the earth take me?
S29E04_70#I hear you, my friend.
S29E04_73#Mmm, candy.
S29E04_75#Homer, no!
S29E04_77#Don't be silly, honey.
S29E04_78#Chocolate doesn't feel anything.
S29E04_80#No! God, no!
S29E04_82#Dad...!
S29E04_84#I can't listen to this horror!
S29E04_86#Okay, I'm on it.
S29E04_88#Thank you.
S29E04_129#It's here! Maggie's first Pazuzu!
S29E04_132#Your father ordered this because...
S29E04_134#Mm, why did you order this?
S29E04_136#I thought it was pizza.
S29E04_137#Yeah, I'll send it back tomorrow.
S29E04_139#Tonight we have a cocktail party.
S29E04_142#And we came early.
S29E04_144#And I left my face on your hand towel.
S29E04_155#Don't worry, Maggie.
S29E04_157#While Mommy and Daddy carouse downstairs,
S29E04_160#you'll be here in the dark with Pazuzu!
S29E04_164#*When Pazuzu's eyes are glaring*
S29E04_167#*It's time to go to bed*
S29E04_171#*You'll see demon shadows fighting*
S29E04_174#*But it's just inside your head*
S29E04_178#*When Pazuzu's eyes are staring*
S29E04_182#*The moonlight will turn red*
S29E04_186#*'Cause Pazuzu's in your nightmares*
S29E04_192#*Until we all are dead.*
S29E04_195#Sweet dreams, Maggie.
S29E04_197#Don't let the Beelzebubs bite.
S29E04_206#Nobody's eating my chowder.
S29E04_208#Maybe I can take it back home with me.
S29E04_215#Maggie, sweetie, you should be in bed.
S29E04_219#No one leaves alive.
S29E04_221#Ooh, her first words!
S29E04_223#Did someone get that on their phone?
S29E04_225#Aw, she's got red eye.
S29E04_227#She's a demon from hell!
S29E04_229#Also, generic cola?
S29E04_230#Really?
S29E04_233#Cocktail fail.
S29E04_235#Thank you.
S29E04_245#Well, at least we still got the liquor.
S29E04_252#Ah, my chowder!
S29E04_254#Someone's starting the terrible twos.
S29E04_257#Someone's having an affair with his nurse.
S29E04_262#- Say "Ah." - A... dulterer.
S29E04_265#179? I...
S29E04_270#I'm afraid that little devil needs an exorcism.
S29E04_274#I'm afraid they didn't teach me those at Pepperdine.
S29E04_279#Bible ribbons, that'll hold her.
S29E04_284#Oh, good, the police are here.
S29E04_291#When is that exorcist gonna get here?
S29E04_293#Marge, we'll be fine.
S29E04_295#Maggie just learned what a circle is.
S29E04_299#Okay, whoever she stops at has to change her diaper,
S29E04_302#which appears to contain flaming lava.
S29E04_304#Oh, you just never want to change a diaper.
S29E04_308#I'll handle this.
S29E04_322#Oops. Sorry about that.
S29E04_324#First thing, we'll see just how powerful
S29E04_326#our demon here truly is.
S29E04_329#The chicken goes...
S29E04_334#Well, there's only one answer here,
S29E04_336#- cut her loose! - Are you sure?
S29E04_338#If you can't trust a Catholic priest with a child,
S29E04_340#who can you trust?
S29E04_351#By the power of Christ, I say devil be out!
S29E04_354#That's all you've got?
S29E04_356#Well, I say it three times.
S29E04_357#This guy's good.
S29E04_358#Devil be out!
S29E04_361#I am Pazuzu, 
S29E04_363#demon of the southwest wind.
S29E04_367#Wait, wait, so you're not even as powerful as the south wind
S29E04_369#or the west wind?
S29E04_370#How lame is that?
S29E04_372#I used to be very important.
S29E04_373#Google it.
S29E04_375#Devil be out!
S29E04_378#Google it!
S29E04_386#Your baby is saved.
S29E04_387#Fantastic.
S29E04_389#She's not going to be a religious weirdo, is she?
S29E04_392#- No. - Fantastic.
S29E04_393#Now hush.
S29E04_395#Pazuzu is still among us.
S29E04_397#But where?
S29E04_401#Bart?
S29E04_403#Let me out, let me out!
S29E04_405#This boy has the darkest soul I've ever seen.
S29E04_408#It's worse than working for David Schwimmer!
S29E04_411#Yo, Pazuzu, grow me some horns.
S29E04_415#Those aren't horns, those are nubs.
S29E04_419#No, no, no!
S29E04_421#Well, at least it'll get me out of jury duty.
S29E04_430#*Lisa, Lisa wants a better life*
S29E04_434#*Lisa, Lisa, go under the knife*
S29E04_437#*Homer, Homer got a button wife.*
S29E04_442#So, anyone want to pick up litter at the park today?
S29E04_445#How about you, Maggie?
S29E04_447#She's still got a touch of Pazuzu.
S29E04_449#At least she never threw up.
S29E04_458#That's just great.
S29E04_460#Everywhere but the sink.
S29E04_464#Sometimes I think I was born in the wrong family.
S29E04_468#Hey, Mr. Cat.
S29E04_470#What are you playing with?
S29E04_472#A secret door?
S29E04_474#We don't have smoke alarms, but we have this?
S29E04_477#Smoke is its own alarm.
S29E04_480#No, no, Snowball, come back!
S29E04_481#It's too dangerous!
S29E04_488#Sometimes tiny doors lead to big opportunities.
S29E04_492#- You could talk? - Indeed.
S29E04_494#For centuries, the cat has been the symbol of intelligence,
S29E04_497#the other world savoir faire...
S29E04_498#Ooh, shiny!
S29E04_500#Oh, there it is. Where'd it go?
S29E04_502#There it is. Where'd it go?
S29E04_504#There it is. Where'd it go?
S29E04_505#Enough.
S29E04_507#Let's go meet your other family.
S29E04_510#Other family?
S29E04_513#Already the talking cat isn't the most interesting thing.
S29E04_522#For a Halloween show middle segment, this is amazing.
S29E04_530#Every girl's dream, a perfect family.
S29E04_536#Good morning, sleepyhead.
S29E04_539#For breakfast, tofu or kale?
S29E04_541#Oh, that's nice.
S29E04_543#But what's with the button eyes?
S29E04_545#We don't all have button eyes, silly.
S29E04_547#Some have button mouths.
S29E04_549#What's up?!
S29E04_551#Lisa, would you like to jam with us?
S29E04_554#You like jazz?
S29E04_569#You're all good, but not better than me.
S29E04_572#I wish I could stay forever.
S29E04_574#But you can.
S29E04_576#All right. Let me guess.
S29E04_578#Do you have to sew buttons over my eyes?
S29E04_581#Don't worry, sugar plum,
S29E04_583#we'll give you a button to bite on
S29E04_584#while we sew 'em on.
S29E04_586#Hold steady.
S29E04_592#Oh, sweetie, you're just in time.
S29E04_594#I killed a snake with your saxophone and...
S29E04_595#Can you blow its head out?
S29E04_597#Here, let me just wipe the blood off the mouthpiece.
S29E04_599#Buttons, please.
S29E04_605#Something's missing.
S29E04_607#Didn't we have a kid between Bart and the baby?
S29E04_610#Little smarty pants, plays the flute, I think.
S29E04_613#Lisa. She's been gone for days.
S29E04_616#And the police have been no help.
S29E04_618#That's not true. I helped you reassemble that high chair.
S29E04_621#Damn it!
S29E04_628#Well, we got two kids now, so no favoritism.
S29E04_631#Maggie will get Lisa's room, Maggie will get Lisa's clothes,
S29E04_633#Bart will get Lisa's homework.
S29E04_635#Cowabunga!
S29E04_639#Bart! How'd you find me?
S29E04_641#I had an informant.
S29E04_643#I know, he can talk.
S29E04_645#He can? I just followed him in.
S29E04_647#Oh, God. Now I'll have to talk to him.
S29E04_651#Uh, I don't think he's coming back.
S29E04_653#How can you be so calm?
S29E04_655#I bore both those children.
S29E04_658#Hey, your stories aren't great, but I wouldn't call them boring.
S29E04_661#I'm going in there now.
S29E04_666#You really did it this time, Homer.
S29E04_668#You lost your family.
S29E04_670#Wait, you can speak on this side?
S29E04_673#Yes, I just don't like to.
S29E04_675#Makes the dog feel inferior.
S29E04_676#All right.
S29E04_680#Oh! So tight.
S29E04_682#Why did I eat that second lunch at lunch?
S29E04_685#Someone kick me in the ass!
S29E04_686#Thank you!
S29E04_690#What is it about this world that's so great?
S29E04_693#The Homer in this world doesn't pass gas.
S29E04_696#That was a three-button job.
S29E04_699#Would you like to have two eyes?
S29E04_701#We can talk to each other while you watch TV.
S29E04_704#Just what Homer needs, an excuse to get lazier.
S29E04_706#Why, you little...
S29E04_709#I'll lazy you, you otherworldly...
S29E04_712#- What the... - That was my Bart!
S29E04_715#Boy, sure is hard to see with buttons on your eyes.
S29E04_720#You killed my husband!
S29E04_724#Spider wife, dead son, two girls with button eyes?
S29E04_728#I think this marriage has finally gotten out of its rut.
S29E04_733#Yep, I got everything just the way I want it,
S29E04_736#including an extra me to go to parent-teacher conferences.
S29E04_740#Bart drew this picture of his family.
S29E04_742#Now we're getting visits from a social worker
S29E04_744#and an exterminator.
S29E04_746#I'll be ready.
S29E04_749#And I've learned, no matter how bad things are,
S29E04_752#they can get much, much worse.
S29E04_755#Huh, you're telling me.
S29E04_764#No one will be seated during the third act
S29E04_766#of this Halloween show.
S29E04_768#What you're about to see is so disgusting
S29E04_771#you'll watch Game of Thrones to calm down.
S29E04_774#You have been warned.
S29E04_789#Man, am I jealous of you guys.
S29E04_792#Two weeks in Lima, Ohio, with Patty and Selma
S29E04_795#while I'm stuck here working.
S29E04_797#It's gonna be lonely. So lonely.
S29E04_800#Well, if you really want us to stay...
S29E04_802#We've already kissed good-bye and the car heard it!
S29E04_808#They're gone. Not a second to waste.
S29E04_816#*Left alone again*
S29E04_818#*Yes, I'm eating provolone again*
S29E04_822#*Food just tastes better in the bathroom now and then*
S29E04_825#*I just love being left alone again*
S29E04_829#*Left alone for days*
S29E04_832#*I ate two dozen bags of Frito-Lays*
S29E04_835#*I'm gonna brush my teeth with mayonnaise*
S29E04_839#*Now my sweat tastes just like doughnut glaze*
S29E04_850#Not a single morsel in the house!
S29E04_854#A forgotten hot dog.
S29E04_857#Oh, you're shivering.
S29E04_859#I'll take care of that.
S29E04_863#*Happy birthday to meat*
S29E04_865#*I can't wait to eat*
S29E04_867#Now to slit it down the middle
S29E04_870#I'm not splitting it with you.
S29E04_872#I'm just teaching you how it's done.
S29E04_876#Still frozen.
S29E04_880#My finger!
S29E04_882#My hot dog!
S29E04_889#My finger! My poor...
S29E04_892#delicious finger.
S29E04_895#Wait a minute. I can't eat my own finger. It's unholy.
S29E04_897#Also, it's not quite done.
S29E04_899#But sometimes a man has to do the unthinkable,
S29E04_903#like eat something medium-rare.
S29E04_908#*Hey, you ate you*
S29E04_910#*You tasted great, you*
S29E04_912#*Hey, you ate you, hey, you ate you*
S29E04_914#*You cooked and ate you*
S29E04_927#It makes complete sense.
S29E04_929#I eat more and exercise less than the most succulent pig.
S29E04_932#Of course I'm delicious!
S29E04_935#But I must never eat me again. Never!
S29E04_938#On the other hand is my other finger.
S29E04_941#And one thing I love is consistency.
S29E04_947#Hey, there, Homer Aloner.
S29E04_949#In the absence of the missus, you want something delicious?
S29E04_954#Don't worry, I'll be back.
S29E04_964#Ooh, yuck.
S29E04_966#Oh, disgusting.
S29E04_968#Homer Simpson, you don't like steak anymore?
S29E04_971#Actually, I've become a bit of a me-gan.
S29E04_974#Do you have any spaghetti with my-balls? Uh, meatballs?
S29E04_976#"Me-gan? My-balls?"
S29E04_978#Are you eating forbidden fruit?
S29E04_980#Fruit? 
S29E04_986#Sorry, Flanders,
S29E04_988#but I've got more delicious meat in my little finger
S29E04_991#than you have on this whole picnic table.
S29E04_993#Speaking of which...
S29E04_1025#I have really gone to a lot of trouble
S29E04_1028#not to leave the house.
S29E04_1030#Homie, we're home!
S29E04_1033#What's with the gloves?
S29E04_1036#I was watching Breakfast at Tiffany's,
S29E04_1038#and I thought I could be more elegant.
S29E04_1040#Elegant? With your waistline?
S29E04_1042#I don't think so.
S29E04_1045#Actually, Homer, you look like you've lost 20 pounds.
S29E04_1049#Well, I have been cutting back.
S29E04_1051#That means something different to me than you.
S29E04_1052#What's wrong with your leg?
S29E04_1054#Nothing. It was perfect.
S29E04_1065#Homie, you shouldn't be snacking in the middle of the night.
S29E04_1068#It can't be good for your...
S29E04_1074#This is, without question,
S29E04_1077#the worst moment of our entire marriage.
S29E04_1080#- What about... - This is worse.
S29E04_1081#Opa!
S29E04_1083#Marge, I admit it, this is a rough patch.
S29E04_1085#But I know when to stop.
S29E04_1087#And when would that be? When you're just a mouth?
S29E04_1090#You see how she is, Doc? Always negative.
S29E04_1092#She makes me feel like nothing.
S29E04_1094#You are almost nothing!
S29E04_1096#Almost nothing.
S29E04_1098#Homer, have you considered your wife's feelings?
S29E04_1100#Perhaps she takes this new diet of yours
S29E04_1103#as a comment on her cooking.
S29E04_1104#Marge?
S29E04_1105#I won't deny that's a part of it.
S29E04_1107#See? Progress.
S29E04_1108#Now, excuse me.
S29E04_1110#I need to go get famous talking about you.
S29E04_1113#Homie, I'm afraid this is it.
S29E04_1117#Your self-destructive behavior has gone too far.
S29E04_1119#But, Marge...
S29E04_1122#Good-bye, my love.
S29E04_1126#Maybe, deep down, that's why I ate myself...
S29E04_1129#Because I hate myself.
S29E04_1131#Sounds like someone had a breakthrough.
S29E04_1134#Hi. I'm famous cooker-upper Mario Batali.
S29E04_1137#- You mean "Chef"? - I don't care for that term.
S29E04_1139#Well, I know I don't belong in therapy, but why are you?
S29E04_1143#I got depressed because I ran out of exciting new ingredients.
S29E04_1146#Homer, we need to talk.
S29E04_1148#Could we wok and talk?
S29E04_1150#Well, sure.
S29E04_1161#My dearest family, I love you so much.
S29E04_1164#And I think I've found a way to earn your forgiveness.
S29E04_1166#Please come home.
S29E04_1169#Come home to flavor.
S29E04_1179#He wanted me to pass on these final words.
S29E04_1181#"I've failed as a man,
S29E04_1183#but I have succeeded as an ingredient."
S29E04_1184#I call the brain!
S29E04_1189#He's gone.
S29E04_1193#Well, I guess I can be proud that he succeeded at something.
S29E04_1196#Oh, it's a lot more than something.
S29E04_1198#Homer's the biggest thing in food since free refills.
S29E04_1202#*Hey, you ate you*
S29E04_1204#*You tasted great, you*
S29E04_1206#*Hey, you ate you, hey, you ate you*
S29E04_1208#*You cooked and ate you*
S29E04_1210#How did they get so much meat out of Homer?
S29E04_1213#Well, they mixed in some Barney, Comic Book Guy and horse.
S29E04_1215#Horse?!
S29E04_1218#Do you know what it's like to have everyone
S29E04_1220#eat of your body?
S29E04_1222#Yeah, like, every Sunday, pal.
S29E04_1226#you know, you don't get more of those.
S29E05_139#Great birthday trip.
S29E05_142#One more thing to remind me of my insignificance.
S29E05_147#Two adults, one student, 
S29E05_148#one boy who just phones it in,
S29E05_150#and a senior citizen veteran on his birthday.
S29E05_153#Oh, and I'd like to apply my astronaut discount.
S29E05_155#I'll need to see your diaper.
S29E05_159#Typical cheapskate Homer.
S29E05_161#Taking all the fun out of turning 87.
S29E05_164#Get this stupid party hat off me!
S29E05_165#What the...?
S29E05_166#Oh, I'll fix it.
S29E05_176#182!
S29E05_178#Homer, that's your weight on the moon.
S29E05_181#I used to be a planet.
S29E05_183#Then one day they called and said it was over.
S29E05_185#It's over when I say it's over!
S29E05_187#So sad.
S29E05_189#But I'll be back.
S29E05_190#I'm working on some stuff.
S29E05_193#Let's just say you might not be seeing Halley's Comet no more.
S29E05_202#Losers.
S29E05_210#Forged in a nanosecond in the Big Bang,
S29E05_213#our universe is so enormous,
S29E05_216#every NFL stadium could fit inside it.
S29E05_219#And their parking lots.
S29E05_223#When's this show gonna start?
S29E05_225#It has started.
S29E05_227#How can it have started if I'm talking?
S29E05_229#Wouldn't that bother everyone?
S29E05_232#Quiet! I can't hear the Big Bang!
S29E05_236#Approximately 13.8 billion years ago...
S29E05_238#- Billion? - ...the universe consisted of
S29E05_241#a tiny singularity of enormous mass,
S29E05_243#which suddenly 
S29E05_245#burst forth in the greatest explosion ever.
S29E05_248#Fire in the theater!
S29E05_251#No! Your pupils aren't ready for Earth light!
S29E05_256#Damn it, I was developing film!
S29E05_266#Turn it up!
S29E05_267#I can't hear it!
S29E05_269#Louder!
S29E05_272#Keep it down!
S29E05_281#Happy birthday.
S29E05_283#I never want to hear that again!
S29E05_286#*Happy birthday to you*
S29E05_291#*Happy birthday to you.*
S29E05_295#Say my name, you cowards!
S29E05_297#Make a wish, party pooper.
S29E05_299#Okay, I will.
S29E05_304#That was a coincidence.
S29E05_307#I got you the one birthday present
S29E05_309#you can really use.
S29E05_311#A call girl that kills me after?
S29E05_313#- A hearing aid. - A hearing aid?
S29E05_316#Forget it. People will think I'm old, dadgummit.
S29E05_318#You are old.
S29E05_320#You've lived long enough to see your prejudiced attitudes
S29E05_323#come back into fashion.
S29E05_325#Lousy Greeks.
S29E05_360#Thank you.
S29E05_363#Bart! Bart!
S29E05_364#Wake up.
S29E05_366#- Yo. What's up? - Listen.
S29E05_369#The planetarium said the universe is 13.8 billion years old.
S29E05_372#But I turned in a paper where I said million!
S29E05_375#What do you want from me?
S29E05_378#I was just wondering
S29E05_381#if you were planning on breaking into the school anytime soon.
S29E05_384#You know, like, maybe tonight.
S29E05_385#Nope. Not till next month.
S29E05_386#Please.
S29E05_388#I'll do your homework!
S29E05_390#Sounds like you can't even do your own homework.
S29E05_392#Yeah, you think about that
S29E05_394#while I'm breaking you into the school.
S29E05_397#Who's breaking into the school?
S29E05_399#Bart's just talking in his sleep!
S29E05_402#I believe that. Trust you. Good night!
S29E05_407#How did you know this door was broken?
S29E05_409#Eh, Willie keeps me posted.
S29E05_411#I keep him in licorice.
S29E05_414#Willie's riding the red pony tonight.
S29E05_426#Look who's got pumpkin stickers!
S29E05_428#Bart, those are for Halloween.
S29E05_431#Also Thanksgiving if there's some left over.
S29E05_440#Where has this been all my life?
S29E05_442#Come on, let's go!
S29E05_445#Okay. You fixed your stupid paper,
S29E05_447#and I scored the teacher's nicotine gum.
S29E05_449#She does that so she doesn't smell like cigarettes, you know.
S29E05_452#Yeah, and she should also get some booze gum.
S29E05_457#What's that?
S29E05_459#Maybe it's the ghost of that boy
S29E05_461#who had to climb that rope in gym until his heart exploded.
S29E05_464#You're making that up.
S29E05_466#Am I that creative?
S29E05_467#No.
S29E05_482#Oh, God.
S29E05_487#Principal Skinner.
S29E05_489#Are you living in the school?
S29E05_492#Absolutely not. And you have no proof.
S29E05_500#Seymour, why are you living here? You have a house.
S29E05_502#With 30 pizzas on the way.
S29E05_504#30 pizzas.
S29E05_506#I can finally send mama back to Italy! Mwah!
S29E05_508#It's not my house, it's Mother's.
S29E05_511#But after what I just found out she did, I can never go back.
S29E05_514#They say it's better to talk about it, but I never will.
S29E05_516#- Okay. - We understand.
S29E05_518#Seriously, don't ask what it was.
S29E05_521#- Are you asking? - I was stretching.
S29E05_522#Then why'd you only stretch one arm?
S29E05_524#It's the only arm that needed stretching.
S29E05_525#Fine, I'll tell you what it was.
S29E05_527#-You don't have to. -Really, it's okay. We believe you.
S29E05_529#Ever since I was a kid,
S29E05_531#I-I wanted to be a drummer.
S29E05_532#-In a rock band? -No.
S29E05_533#Marching.
S29E05_537#I would've given all I had to be the dot on that "I."
S29E05_540#It's also called a "Tittle."
S29E05_541#Don't you think I know that?
S29E05_543#I did everything I could to make that band.
S29E05_546#In my application, I sent songs and choreographies.
S29E05_560#I'm a shoo-in!
S29E05_569#Then the fateful day came.
S29E05_572#Son, you got a letter from Ohio State University.
S29E05_575#I'm too nervous to get up.
S29E05_577#- Do you want me to read it to you? -Yes.
S29E05_581#I'm sorry.
S29E05_583#You were rejected.
S29E05_585#Uh, seems kind of thick.
S29E05_586#Well, they gave you a lot of reasons
S29E05_587#why you weren't good enough.
S29E05_591#That's so sad.
S29E05_593#There's more I have to tell you.
S29E05_595#I was going to surprise Mother by papering her drawers,
S29E05_598#then I found this.
S29E05_599#I was accepted.
S29E05_600#She lied.
S29E05_602#That's so sad.
S29E05_604#What makes this really tragic
S29E05_606#is there was also a personal handwritten letter
S29E05_607#from the Director of Admissions.
S29E05_608#Dear Seymour, 
S29E05_610#I truly hope you'll accept a full scholarship
S29E05_613#to come to Ohio State. 
S29E05_616#We want to make use of your brillant formations immediately
S29E05_619#What's that smell?
S29E05_620#I'm making spaghetti and kick balls.
S29E05_624#And in a fantastic coincidence,
S29E05_626#our current marching band director is due to retire in four years 
S29E05_629#and I can't of a better replacement.
S29E05_633#You'll live a life at the pinnacle of Columbus society
S29E05_636#and be buried at the fifty-yard line
S29E05_639#where you will witness coin tosses for all eternity.
S29E05_643#Does it get worse than that?
S29E05_645#How could it be worse than that?
S29E05_647#May I see the letter?
S29E05_649#I must say your sympathy is a pleasant surprise.
S29E05_652#No, this is just the only college acceptance letter
S29E05_653#I'll ever hold.
S29E05_663#So it's for all these reasons that I will not be seeking
S29E05_665#a seat in the U.S. Senate.
S29E05_667#I will now take a few questions.
S29E05_669#Let me tell you the wonderful present I just got.
S29E05_672#Dad! What a surprise!
S29E05_673#What's he doing here?
S29E05_675#Didn't we just see him yesterday?
S29E05_677#That's what they're saying under their breath?
S29E05_679#How awful! I want to hear all of it.
S29E05_682#Maybe if we pretend we're tired, he'll go home.
S29E05_689#Thank God he can't hear us.
S29E05_691#And I'm glad these fake yawns
S29E05_693#are something we can do as a family.
S29E05_695#What?! You, too?!
S29E05_697#Good-bye!
S29E05_698#Dad, wait!
S29E05_699#What's wrong with the old coot?
S29E05_701#I mean, what's wrong with you, you sweet old coot?
S29E05_705#I got a hearing aid, and I heard everything you said.
S29E05_709#We didn't mean the mean things we meant.
S29E05_711#We just said them because we meant them.
S29E05_715#I am gone forever!
S29E05_720#A little mall walk will cheer me up.
S29E05_727#Oh,old guy. Don't make eye contact.
S29E05_729#Rubbing them is like working dry lasagna.
S29E05_732#Old guy! Here he comes!
S29E05_734#He'll want to try all my lotion samples.
S29E05_736#I'll have to explain what "Send" Is on a cell phone.
S29E05_745#Come in! Come in!
S29E05_748#Well, that's more like it.
S29E05_756#I had to cheat.
S29E05_758#I was doing it for the bell curve.
S29E05_761#And with 99% of the vote in,
S29E05_764#the next president is Lisa Simps--
S29E05_766#Wait a minute.
S29E05_769#I'm being told she cheated on a paper in second grade.
S29E05_771#She is disqualified,
S29E05_773#making our next president Kenny Hitler.
S29E05_776#No!
S29E05_780#Hey, welcome to Bob Hope's USO Show,
S29E05_784#or as I like to call it, Christmas away from Dolores.
S29E05_788#That could've been me on those drums.
S29E05_790#I would've gotten to rehearse at his house in Toluca Lake.
S29E05_793#Toluca Lake!
S29E05_797#What'll it be?
S29E05_799#Can an old vet have a beer and tell you his troubles?
S29E05_802#Sure.
S29E05_813#And that's how I opened the orange.
S29E05_822#So, uh, my mother didn't tell me I got in.
S29E05_825#That's all right. You can enroll now.
S29E05_827#- Can I? - No!
S29E05_829#This is a school, not an '80s comedy.
S29E05_831#That, uh, letter you sent me...
S29E05_833#is that something you send every student?
S29E05_835#No, I only sent that once, to you.
S29E05_837#When you didn't show up,
S29E05_839#that was the second worst day of my career.
S29E05_841#What was the worst?
S29E05_843#The day the Big Ten expanded to 14 schools.
S29E05_845#What are we, morons?
S29E05_848#We didn't even notice till Northwestern pointed it out.
S29E05_853#Oh, I'm sorry, should I not have told you about the letter?
S29E05_855#Uh, no.
S29E05_858#It's actually good, because I'm no longer sad.
S29E05_860#I'm angry!
S29E05_863#It's time for a furious self-guided tour of this campus.
S29E05_876#I've never seen someone walk the oval so many times.
S29E05_878#He's got to be dizzy.
S29E05_880#I switch directions every other lap.
S29E05_885#- Oh, uh, Michigan sucks. - What?
S29E05_889#That's how we say "Excuse me" Around here.
S29E05_892#*Loser, loser*
S29E05_895#*Loser, loser*
S29E05_898#*Missed opportunity*
S29E05_900#*All over now*
S29E05_902#*You poor bastard.*
S29E05_904#Et Tu, Brutus?
S29E05_908#Okay, Mother, it's time for an unpleasant confrontation.
S29E05_914#Class, I'm going to hand back your astronomy papers.
S29E05_917#Keep calm. Keep calm.
S29E05_919#No one knows you did anything wrong.
S29E05_921#Lisa Simpson, come to my desk.
S29E05_926#Miss Hoover, I have to confess. I changed my paper.
S29E05_929#It said million, but I knew it was billion.
S29E05_931#Oh, please.
S29E05_934#Maybe I can start a new life in the other second grade class.
S29E05_938#I know you changed your paper.
S29E05_939#I don't care about your grade.
S29E05_941#Where the hell is my nicotine gum?
S29E05_945#My brother had it, and he was hanging around the class pet.
S29E05_950#I'll get you some more gum.
S29E05_952#You do that.
S29E05_966#Can I help you?
S29E05_967#What are you doing here?
S29E05_969#Your mother rented me your room.
S29E05_971#You rented my room to the town drunk?
S29E05_974#I am also the state drunk.
S29E05_977#What do you want?
S29E05_980#You know?
S29E05_982#Yes. Yes, I do.
S29E05_984#Oh, son, forgive me.
S29E05_985#I'm so sorry.
S29E05_988#I just couldn't bear to lose you like I'd lost everything else.
S29E05_992#Oh, I would've arranged for you to live near me in the dorm.
S29E05_995#Oh, I can't live in a college town.
S29E05_997#Can't control myself sexually.
S29E05_1000#What you did to me was the worst thing anyone could do to anyone,
S29E05_1003#much less a mother to her son.
S29E05_1005#I really don't know what you could say.
S29E05_1007#Son, I guess when you get right down to it,
S29E05_1011#I've always felt marching bands are a colossal waste of time.
S29E05_1014#The music and the walking both suffer.
S29E05_1016#You may have a point.
S29E05_1018#And you'll always be my little tittle.
S29E05_1023#- Is that a tear? - Maybe.
S29E05_1030#Please, I beg you.
S29E05_1031#Will you move back in?
S29E05_1033#There are gonna have to be some changes.
S29E05_1035#What kind of changes?
S29E05_1037#Well, I want the parental controls taken off the TV.
S29E05_1039#You'll just watch booby programs.
S29E05_1042#If I'm in the booby mood, yes, I will.
S29E05_1045#Welcome back, son.
S29E05_1047#Looks like I got a little brother!
S29E05_1049#He's not staying, is he?
S29E05_1050#You boys work it out.
S29E05_1052#We sure will, Ma.
S29E05_1058#You still haven't found Grampa?
S29E05_1061#No. But I found this guy who's willing to take his place.
S29E05_1064#I am Grandpapa.
S29E05_1066#Gather the grandchildren
S29E05_1068#that we might play the Hungry Hungry Hippos.
S29E05_1071#I don't think anyone can replace our Grampa.
S29E05_1074#Are you sure? Your husband...
S29E05_1076#she looked through hundreds of grandpapas.
S29E05_1079#This was my third callback!
S29E05_1080#Make a choice.
S29E05_1083#Yello.
S29E05_1085#Is this the no-good ungrateful son of Abraham Simpson?
S29E05_1088#- Speaking. - I'm gonna send him back to you,
S29E05_1090#and I don't want to see him here again.
S29E05_1092#This place is really depressing.
S29E05_1094#And he does not help.
S29E05_1096#There's a pathetic old drunk peeing himself in the bathroom.
S29E05_1098#That's a mirror.
S29E05_1100#And it's not the bathroom.
S29E05_1108#When is Grampa gonna get here?
S29E05_1109#I knew it.
S29E05_1111#Still bad-mouthing me behind my back.
S29E05_1114#I can't believe it, but I miss him so much.
S29E05_1117#I love him, too.
S29E05_1119#I just can't say it to his beautiful shriveled turnip head.
S29E05_1124#I love how he knows what every building used to be.
S29E05_1127#And Maggie says...
S29E05_1131#U. R. A. D. Light.
S29E05_1139#Come get your Grampa, you sweet slices of melon.
S29E05_1145#we love you.
S29E05_1156#What are you watching?
S29E05_1157#It's a booby movie, isn't it?
S29E05_1159#It's Emmy-winning premium cable.
S29E05_1161#Do they show boobs?
S29E05_1162#Not since they started winning Emmys.
S29E05_1163#Very disappointing.
S29E05_1165#Well, I guess I'll watch with you.
S29E05_1167#What's that thing?
S29E05_1169#It's a raven from the Lannister's Maester.
S29E05_1171#What's a Lannister? What's a Maester?
S29E05_1173#House Lannister is the wealthiest...
S29E05_1175#- Is that a dragon? - Yes.
S29E05_1176#This is stupid.
S29E05_1186#*He walks down the street*
S29E05_1188#*He falls in a hole, man*
S29E05_1192#*Everyone knows Hans Moleman!*
S29E05_1193#Who?
S29E05_1195#Nobody knows Hans Moleman.
S29E05_1197#Next.
S29E05_1199#I was here first.

S29E05_1203#*He doesn't even scan*
S29E05_1205#*Nobody knows Hans Moleman.*
S29E05_1208#I just need my heart pills.
S29E05_1211#*Nobody knows Hans Moleman.*
S29E06_117#This is Kent Brockman on location
S29E06_119#among the good people of Springfield.
S29E06_122#Coward!
S29E06_124#Because today, we celebrate beautiful Skyline Park,
S29E06_127#a reclamation project built atop the ruins
S29E06_129#of the Springfield Monorail.
S29E06_131#Monorail. Monorail. Monorail. Monorail.
S29E06_134#No, they're not building a new monorail.
S29E06_136#Why not? This one couldn't fail.
S29E06_138#Couldn't fail. Couldn't fail.
S29E06_140#*It's a monstrous creation*
S29E06_142#*Of mass transportation*
S29E06_147#Throw me again!
S29E06_150#No, we're repurposing the old monorail track
S29E06_152#into a completely new and original feature
S29E06_154#we ripped off from New York:
S29E06_156#the Springfield Skypark-Line.
S29E06_159#I love this space.
S29E06_161#Planters, benches,
S29E06_163#solar-powered talking trash cans.
S29E06_167#Thank you for the used porn.
S29E06_179# okay, uh, do we go, uh,
S29E06_181#gut to gut or, uh, butt-butt to nut?
S29E06_183#Don't worry, we'll use the bypass board.
S29E06_187#Okay, fatsos, suck it in.
S29E06_195#I got Homer's sandwich.
S29E06_196#I got Wiggum's gun.
S29E06_198#And now, to culminate today's events,
S29E06_200#let's turn on the electricity
S29E06_203#that illuminates the tiny "No smoking" Signs.
S29E06_218#Somehow the track is getting juice!
S29E06_222#Yes! Now to put it on power save.
S29E06_226#The monorail-- it's alive!
S29E06_228#I warned you not to...
S29E06_250#Welcome, senior citizen.
S29E06_260#No more Nimoy!
S29E06_266#On the positive side, with this disaster,
S29E06_269#we have surpassed Detroit and Kabul
S29E06_272#as the world's most unlucky city.
S29E06_276#Couldn't you have at least put little wedges under the wheels?
S29E06_279#Er, uh, sorry, sweetheart, but running a city 
S29E06_283#is a little more complicated than getting your nails done.
S29E06_286#Don't you worry
S29E06_288#your pretty little head about it.
S29E06_290#Mr. Mayor, that is so sexist.
S29E06_293#Uh-oh, sounds like someone's girdle is pinching.
S29E06_297#Well, now, it's all in fun.
S29E06_299#No one respects you ladies more than I.
S29E06_302#Now if you wouldn't mind serving the coffee and cake,
S29E06_304#we men can get down to business.
S29E06_307#This is the last time I'm doing this.
S29E06_309#So I better do it perfectly.
S29E06_311#Here you go, Dr. Hibbert.
S29E06_316#I can't believe Mayor Quimby talking down to me like that.
S29E06_319#And by the way, women don't wear girdles anymore.
S29E06_321#We wear Spanx and other shapewear.
S29E06_324#Tell me about it.
S29E06_329#People think we've moved on, 
S29E06_331#but this world is as sexist as ever.
S29E06_333#Thanks, Obama.
S29E06_335#What's so great about Quimby anyway?
S29E06_337#I could cut a ribbon.
S29E06_338#And I could make it curl nicely
S29E06_340#using the edge of the giant scissors.
S29E06_343#You'd be a great mayor, Mom.
S29E06_345#You're organized, you manage the budget,
S29E06_347#and thanks to Dad, you're an expert on the court system.
S29E06_350#By that, being a defendant gets you out of jury duty.
S29E06_353#Mom, this is our time.
S29E06_356#Wonder Woman showed that if you're a goddess with superpowers, 
S29E06_359#there's no limit to what you can do.
S29E06_361#You could be mayor!
S29E06_365#A woman prime minister, okay.
S29E06_367#Women Ghostbusters, cool.
S29E06_369#Woman head of the Federal Reserve,
S29E06_371#as far as I'm concerned, what's that?
S29E06_372#But a woman mayor?
S29E06_375#If Mom becomes mayor, we can get away with anything.
S29E06_381#Help me, Jesus!
S29E06_388#Pick a side.
S29E06_396#Where'd everybody go?
S29E06_399#Marge, this town is ready for a change.
S29E06_401#Quimby has been mayor, like, forever.
S29E06_403#You'd think he could lose that sash.
S29E06_405#It's like, we know, okay?
S29E06_407#All right now, listen.
S29E06_409#The key to victory is micro-targeting.
S29E06_410#Micro-targeting.
S29E06_412#Think of the voters as a pie.
S29E06_415#Yes, Homer, someone here said "Pie."
S29E06_418#I know, "Mmm, pie."
S29E06_420#I'm sorry, go on.
S29E06_423#Uh, we use data analysis to divide the pie
S29E06_426#into tiny little slivers
S29E06_428#and tailor a message to each micro-group.
S29E06_432#You just tell them what they want to hear until you get 51%.
S29E06_435#Then you can govern like a far-right nut-job.
S29E06_438#*I'm Marge Simpson*
S29E06_441#*And won't you vote for me*
S29E06_444#*Whatever your obsession is*
S29E06_446#*Is my priority*
S29E06_449#I stand with you against revenuers.
S29E06_452#Oh, uh, durn revenuers!
S29E06_455#Well, you's the new John Galt, aren't you?
S29E06_459#Hey, can you take a picture with our Ayn Rand scarecrow?
S29E06_465#*From widows to your lunch pail Joes*
S29E06_468#*To vets of foreign wars*
S29E06_471#*There's no single-issue voter*
S29E06_473#*My campaign will ignore.*
S29E06_476#Marge, we really appreciate this.
S29E06_478#You're the first politician that's ever met with us weirdos.
S29E06_481#What's the biggest issue you exotic pet owners face?
S29E06_484#Keeping our pets from eating each other.
S29E06_487#Yes. As the owner of an impala, I...
S29E06_489#- Hey, where'd it go? - Oh, boy.
S29E06_492#*From soccer moms to mafia dons*
S29E06_495#*I'll give you what you need*
S29E06_497#*I'm Marge Simpson*
S29E06_500#*And won't you vote for me? Yeah!*
S29E06_503#Why do people assume all I can do
S29E06_506#is feed spaghetti to dogs that want to make out?
S29E06_508#What do you want to do?
S29E06_510#Carve a little wooden boy and make him come to life.
S29E06_523#Now, for our third and fourth party candidates,
S29E06_525#I regret to say you are just shy of the polling results required,
S29E06_528#so you're excluded from the debate.
S29E06_529#Bye-bye.
S29E06_532#Mrs. Simpson, you've targeted small constituencies.
S29E06_536#Do you have any proposals that would appeal to every Springfielder?
S29E06_540#Well, Kent, I am a mom.
S29E06_543#And as a mom, I want to help this town eat its vegetables.
S29E06_548#Vegetables, Marge?
S29E06_550#As moderator, it's my duty to fact check
S29E06_552#that many of them are yucky.
S29E06_554#It's a metaphor.
S29E06_555#Stinkin' metaphors!
S29E06_557#I only trust similes.
S29E06_559#I enjoy metaphors.
S29E06_561#They're raindrops on the flower that is the ear.
S29E06_563#You put in a "like" or an "as,"
S29E06_565#or so help me you are going down.
S29E06_570#She's completely cooked.
S29E06_572#Unlike the chicken she brought to the potluck.
S29E06_574#Oh, Helen is as bitter as the lemonade
S29E06_576#she brought to the potluck.
S29E06_578#What a terrible potluck that was.
S29E06_581#Why wasn't this a town hall event?
S29E06_584#I like to see them balance on the stools.
S29E06_591#You know, my entire life,
S29E06_593#that stupid tire fire has been burning.
S29E06_595#And it's ruined our town.
S29E06_600#I promise, if you elect me,
S29E06_602#I'll put that fire out.
S29E06_606#No tire fire?
S29E06_608#Ooh, just like Zurich.
S29E06_615#Is that enough?
S29E06_617#And with the last senior citizen gently reminded
S29E06_620#that they cannot vote at IHOP, 
S29E06_622#the results are now final. History is made.
S29E06_624#Marge Simpson is our new mayor.
S29E06_627#The first woman and the second to pee sitting down.
S29E06_630#Marge! Marge! Marge!
S29E06_631#Thank you.
S29E06_635#Homie, you want to make out with the mayor?
S29E06_638#What? No! Ew!
S29E06_641#Oh, you mean you.
S29E06_645#Okay.
S29E06_647#Now I really wish I'd voted.
S29E06_658#Look at me! I'm a public servant!
S29E06_662#And so our new mayor is doing what was unthinkable
S29E06_665#in the Quimby regime: something.
S29E06_668#Roll the 'dozers!
S29E06_678#Well, sorry,
S29E06_680#but I-I can't let you put me out of business.
S29E06_686#You'd ruin the air for the whole town just to sell knickknacks?
S29E06_689#Knickknacks?
S29E06_691#They-they may be to you,
S29E06_693#but, uh, they put my son through med school.
S29E06_697#He named, um, uh, a-a stammer after me.
S29E06_701#You know.
S29E06_704#I failed.
S29E06_706#I failed on my one promise.
S29E06_710#And so, Marge Simpson is already a failure.
S29E06_713#The fastest fall from grace since Mamie Eisenhower
S29E06_715#destroyed a piano store on inauguration day.
S29E06_722#Hey, Mom, want to get some lunch?
S29E06_723#I'd love a lunch break,
S29E06_725#but I've got to get that tire fire out first.
S29E06_728#Already neglecting your family, Madam Mayor?
S29E06_731#Why you little! Don't embarrass your mother!
S29E06_750#Guys, guys, stop!
S29E06_751#I'm the mayor.
S29E06_753#Everything you do reflects on me.
S29E06_754#Of course, honey.
S29E06_756#It's just hard to restrain yourself
S29E06_758#when you're above the law.
S29E06_760#We're not above the law.
S29E06_762#Oh, yeah, yeah, I get it.
S29E06_766#I want you to promise me.
S29E06_768#Can you both behave like Lisa, just for a little bit?
S29E06_772#"I'm Lisa. I'm Lisa."
S29E06_775#"I like music."
S29E06_777#"My boyfriend is broccoli."
S29E06_782#We're here to buy your stand.
S29E06_784#Yeah, well, it's not for sale.
S29E06_787#All I want to do is help this city,
S29E06_789#and I can't because of this ding-dong.
S29E06_793#How dare you insult me like that?
S29E06_795#I was there!
S29E06_797#What? What, what, what, what, what?
S29E06_799#Clyde's a Vietnam vet,
S29E06_801#a survivor of the Battle of Dhing Dhong.
S29E06_802#Thank you.
S29E06_804#Than Kyu was his best friend.
S29E06_806#Stepped on a land mine in the battle of One Pun Too Many.
S29E06_809#This is not good, Marge. Not good.
S29E06_812#Marge's beehive of activity 
S29E06_814#has become a hornet's nest of trouble.
S29E06_817#Also, our news broadcasts have been reduced to two sentences.
S29E06_819#Good night.
S29E06_820#There's only one way out.
S29E06_821#You're gonna have to do a live,
S29E06_823#completely unscripted heart-to-heart with the voters.
S29E06_826#- Here's your script. - I don't want a script.
S29E06_828#Are you nuts?
S29E06_830#Good evening.
S29E06_832#I'm here to talk to you, one-on-one,
S29E06_835#just an ordinary mom sitting in her kitchen.
S29E06_839#This is a disaster.
S29E06_841#I've seen counterclockwise knob turning before,
S29E06_842#but not like this.
S29E06_846#Marge, what time is dinner ready?
S29E06_848#I'm in the middle of a speech.
S29E06_850#So 6:00?
S29E06_851#You'll get it when you get it.
S29E06_853#Wait a minute. Something's turning them around.
S29E06_857#Marge, can you cook a Hot Pocket in the dryer?
S29E06_859#Homer Simpson,
S29E06_862#the only time you shut your mouth is to keep food inside.
S29E06_868#That's it.
S29E06_870#She's turned a gaffe-making tubby
S29E06_871#into a laugh-yielding hubby.
S29E06_872#Does that work?
S29E06_875#Let's see, the subter-hand is all right.
S29E06_877#The math checks out.
S29E06_879#I'll be the Kellyanne Conway of this thing.
S29E06_880#Kellyanne Conway?
S29E06_882#I like how she always looks like she just woke up.
S29E06_886#I think it's inspiring how now a woman can be Joseph Goebbels.
S29E06_893#Marge, do we have any bread?
S29E06_894#Check your chest.
S29E06_899#Oh, my God.
S29E06_901#Those are the highest approval ratings
S29E06_903#I've ever seen for an incumbent: 53%!
S29E06_912#Marge, your numbers are simply fantastic.
S29E06_915#And all you had to do was throw your husband under the bus.
S29E06_918#Well, don't tell me you're sad
S29E06_920#about throwing your husband under the bus.
S29E06_922#I'm happy if he can fit under a bus.
S29E06_923#Zing!
S29E06_925#Yeah. Zing.
S29E06_931#Mr. Simpson, we're naming a sandwich after you.
S29E06_934#My lifelong dream has come true.
S29E06_935#I've got this all planned.
S29E06_937#Start with a full Reuben with all the fixin's.
S29E06_940#Put a club sandwich on top.
S29E06_942#The bottom bun is, at first glance,
S29E06_944#a chicken-fried steak.
S29E06_946#But it's worth a closer look, because...
S29E06_948#Sir, sir, sir. We've already made it.
S29E06_951#The Open-Mouthed Turkey Goofball?
S29E06_954#That is so not me.
S29E06_956#But I'll take six.
S29E06_959#We're honored to have with us the mayor...
S29E06_963#...and First Doofus Homer Simpson.
S29E06_967#Homer's made Marge happy more times 
S29E06_969#than he can count: three!
S29E06_973#And we're here for a very, very serious charity:
S29E06_976#Save the Whales.
S29E06_977#All right, that's it!
S29E06_980#No. That's really why we're here!
S29E06_983#I am not a whale!
S29E06_986#I am a man with blubber and several harpoon scars!
S29E06_1000#What a day for this town.
S29E06_1003#We've made a deal with the librarians' union.
S29E06_1006#Homer would've been here,
S29E06_1008#but he backed out when he heard the library
S29E06_1010#didn't have any pop-up books.
S29E06_1022#Great news, Marge. 
S29E06_1024#You've tapped into something women and men can agree on: 
S29E06_1026#Husbands are idiots.
S29E06_1027#Yeah, I guess.
S29E06_1029#While you're guessing, I'm running with this.
S29E06_1030#Take a look at the balloon we've made
S29E06_1032#for the Thanksgiving parade.
S29E06_1035#I don't care what people say.
S29E06_1038#My Homie makes one sexy blimp.
S29E06_1043#I need to talk to somebody.
S29E06_1051#Mayor Quimby?
S29E06_1054#No, just ordinary Diamond Joe.
S29E06_1056#Uh-oh, I know that look.
S29E06_1058#That's a mayor on the ropes or a wife who wants a divorce.
S29E06_1061#I'm familiar with both.
S29E06_1062#Er, uh, indeed.
S29E06_1065#Joe, is it possible to have a decent family life
S29E06_1068#and be a good political leader?
S29E06_1070#Marge, I don't want to talk about that anymore,
S29E06_1072#but I'll tell you this: retirement agrees with me.
S29E06_1075#The first night out of office,
S29E06_1077#I noticed a gorgeous woman lying next to me,
S29E06_1079#and I said, "Holy crap, I'm married to her."
S29E06_1082#Go long, boys.
S29E06_1090#Marge, there's no "Mayor" in marriage.
S29E06_1093#There almost is. It's really close.
S29E06_1094#But I'm afraid not.
S29E06_1097#Meet you in the boathouse later?
S29E06_1099#Oh, Marge, I want to thank you
S29E06_1101#for giving me back my Joseph.
S29E06_1102#Will you stay?
S29E06_1104#I just made a giant pitcher of gimlets,
S29E06_1107#but I can make a second one if you're staying.
S29E06_1109#No, I have to get back.
S29E06_1111#We're christening a new manhole cover on 4th Street.
S29E06_1114#So sad.
S29E06_1116#Can't you stay for a bit?
S29E06_1118#Uh, we need some help serving coffee and cake.
S29E06_1121#I swear this is the last time.
S29E06_1123#There's more where that came from!
S29E06_1129#Thank you. I couldn't be here without my husband.
S29E06_1134#He's a big supporter.
S29E06_1135#So big...
S29E06_1148#So big, 
S29E06_1151#I wish all of you could know the love in his heart.
S29E06_1155#Everyone, look inside yourself
S29E06_1157#and find your Homer Simpson.
S29E06_1170#It's so beautiful.
S29E06_1174#We make the magic happen, baby.
S29E06_1197#Can we just skip that one?
S29E06_1199#I would, but you have to walk through it
S29E06_1200#to get to the cafeteria.
S29E06_1202#Okay.
S29E07_70#Okily dokily.
S29E07_74#Aw, our own home.
S29E07_89#All right. Takeout Chinese.
S29E07_92#Everyone can have their favorite thing.
S29E07_94#Bart, General Tso's chicken.
S29E07_96#For Lisa, Pacifist Tso's tofu.
S29E07_99#For Maggie, Kung Pao Cheerios.
S29E07_102#And, Homer, I've got your favorite...
S29E07_104#Favorite? That's my favorite.
S29E07_106#...msg.
S29E07_110#Ah, needs salt.
S29E07_115#Y'ello.
S29E07_116#Ahoy-hoy, Simpson.
S29E07_118#I have four seats to tonight's basketball joust,
S29E07_120#and you were at the top of my list.
S29E07_132#So, what do you say?
S29E07_134#Thank you, Mr. Burns.
S29E07_136#Oh, boy, courtside seats.
S29E07_138#I feel like Billy Crystal's doctor.
S29E07_139#Who was it?
S29E07_140#You'll never believe it. We just got...
S29E07_143#Homer, wait. You don't want to go with them.
S29E07_145#Why not? They're my family.
S29E07_147#Sweetie, I know that you're talking to your brain.
S29E07_149#Why don't you just do whatever your heart tells you?
S29E07_152#Ugh, not that guy.
S29E07_154#I'm numb.
S29E07_155#Chest pains!
S29E07_160#Just go to the game with your friends.
S29E07_163#Brain, you're the greatest.
S29E07_164#Is there anything I can do for you?
S29E07_166#Yeah, you could read a book once in a while.
S29E07_172#Carl, I got courtside seats!
S29E07_174#Lenny, I got courtside seats!
S29E07_177#Barney, I got courtside seats!
S29E07_178#I'm in.
S29E07_179#Who's on trial?
S29E07_181#You guys got courtside seats? I'd love to go.
S29E07_184#Just let me lock up the good liquor.
S29E07_189#Uh, sorry, we only have four tickets.
S29E07_192#Me, Lenny, Carl and Barney.
S29E07_193#You really don't want me?
S29E07_195#I, uh, I thought we was friends.
S29E07_196#Yeah, we did, too.
S29E07_198#Then we realized you were serving us beer
S29E07_200#that's mostly suds.
S29E07_202#Also, your chicken wings weren't chicken.
S29E07_204#Hey, meat's meat. Although none of it was meat.
S29E07_206#Look, hey, where we going with this?
S29E07_207#You're not invited, Moe.
S29E07_209#Hey, wha...?
S29E07_212#Not invited, not invited.
S29E07_213#Who's on trial?
S29E07_228#I am truly alone in this world.
S29E07_230#No, you're not.
S29E07_233#Uh, thanks, uh, Anti-Suicide Keychain.
S29E07_235#You're welcome.
S29E07_236#I care about you...
S29E07_238#Uh, Moe Szyslak.
S29E07_240#...very much.
S29E07_248#Moe, about last night...
S29E07_250#Yeah, on the house, fellas.
S29E07_253#And I got new cocktail napkins
S29E07_255#that ain't just unpaid parking tickets.
S29E07_257#See? Yeah, huh?
S29E07_258#How about that?
S29E07_260#Why you being so nice to us after we rejected you?
S29E07_263#Well, maybe the problem wasn't youse, maybe it was mees.
S29E07_266#So, I'se, uh, sprucing up the bar,
S29E07_269#trying to make things nice, you know, like they used to be.
S29E07_273#It's the Pin Pals, our old bowling team!
S29E07_276#Those were great times.
S29E07_277#Them were the best times.
S29E07_279#Closer than brothers, we was, says I.
S29E07_282#Then Apu had his octopuses, and suddenly he didn't have time
S29E07_285#to bowl with his buddies five nights a week.
S29E07_287#But as I said, great times.
S29E07_294#Guys, I think we should reform the Pin Pals,
S29E07_298#but this time with me, Lenny, Carl and Moe!
S29E07_301#Oh, guys, I would love to!
S29E07_303#But I can't bowl no more.
S29E07_305#I got beer-pull tunnel syndrome.
S29E07_311#Another, please.
S29E07_316#It's a little short.
S29E07_321#I guess you'll have to ask Barney to bowl with ya's.
S29E07_324#- Do they have beer? - Yes.
S29E07_326#To bowling!
S29E07_329#*I get knocked down*
S29E07_330#*But I get up again*
S29E07_332#*You're never gonna keep me down... *
S29E07_335#Moe, this is for you.
S29E07_340#- What do you say? - Coach? Terrific!
S29E07_343#I love screaming at people who are trying their best.
S29E07_345#To Moe!
S29E07_347#What are you doing? Don't drink that.
S29E07_348#You're in training.
S29E07_350#*The boys are back in town*
S29E07_352#*Boys are back in town*
S29E07_356#A lot of music in this episode.
S29E07_359#*The boys are back in town*
S29E07_362#*The boys are back in town*
S29E07_363#*Boys are back in town*
S29E07_381#*Boys are back in town*
S29E07_385#*I said the boys are back in town*
S29E07_389#*The boys are back in town*
S29E07_391#Okay, sidekicks, back in our shadows.
S29E07_401#*Hallelujah*
S29E07_403#*Hallelujah*
S29E07_426#We made it, boys.
S29E07_428#Going to the state finals in Capital City!
S29E07_434#Uh, sorry, that's where we store our extra balls.
S29E07_437#Quick! Rest his head!
S29E07_445#Alright, the state finals.
S29E07_448#If we win this, the next tournament is on ESPN8.
S29E07_451#All right, guys, don't be yokels.
S29E07_453#Just act like you seen it all before.
S29E07_455#Holy crap!
S29E07_474#Uh, it says we're on lane 17.
S29E07_477#Topiary lane numbers.
S29E07_479#I'll bet they're plastic.
S29E07_481#Yep, they are, but don't tell management.
S29E07_485#So I guess we're playing you guys, huh?
S29E07_486#Best two out of three.
S29E07_488#I'm Reynolds. We're high-frequency traders.
S29E07_491#I was the model for The Wolf of Wall Street.
S29E07_493#I was the model for American Psycho.
S29E07_498#I was a model for toe fungus in a Dr. Scholl's commercial.
S29E07_501#-And I was... -I'll give you $100 to stop talking.
S29E07_503#Deal!
S29E07_506#Hey, and here's a hundred for you for looking at me
S29E07_509#like I am the most amazing thing you ever saw.
S29E07_512#I think I'm giving you a $500 look.
S29E07_515#Well, here's $400, and screw you.
S29E07_518#Wow. I finally found my path in life: socio.
S29E07_522#Hey, Harold, buddy.
S29E07_524#You know, I was wondering...
S29E07_527#Excuse me. Why cheeseburgers?
S29E07_529#The cheese holds it together in flight. Duh.
S29E07_532#I mean, why do you throw them at good people?
S29E07_534#Question time is over.
S29E07_536#Really hope that social worker pays better
S29E07_538#by the time you grow up.
S29E07_540#Social worker.
S29E07_542#Hey. This little dingus gets it.
S29E07_543#All right, little man.
S29E07_545#From now on, we're gonna call you McDingus.
S29E07_548#You're treating me like dirt!
S29E07_549#I belong!
S29E07_553#I'm wearing a new hat!
S29E07_558#I'm gonna show you that the one thing in the world
S29E07_561#that you're a little bit good at, I'm better.
S29E07_563#Okey-doke.
S29E07_567#Damn it!
S29E07_568#All right, now, listen to me.
S29E07_570#These stuffed suits don't stand a chance
S29E07_571#against us working joes.
S29E07_573#-Because we got... -Moxie?
S29E07_575#-Eh, no. -Uh, grit?
S29E07_576#Nah, we're pretty grit-less.
S29E07_578#Well, what have we got?
S29E07_580#My stepdad is Lebanese.
S29E07_581#We are a damn rainbow!
S29E07_591#We win. We win!
S29E07_592#The first out of three!
S29E07_594#Huh! I haven't been this confident
S29E07_596#since I saw La La Land win Best Picture
S29E07_598#and turned off my TV.
S29E07_600#Good win, you guys.
S29E07_601#Lunch is on us.
S29E07_603#Wow! Is that a Visa double diamond card?
S29E07_606#Yep. Doesn't have to be inserted or swiped.
S29E07_608#It just knows. 
S29E07_611#It can sense that you're poor.
S29E07_615#Once again they substitute rhino for narwhal.
S29E07_618#It's like they think we won't notice.
S29E07_622#Thanks for lunch.
S29E07_624#And now you'll be eating crow for dessert.
S29E07_627#Uh, side note-- I have actually eaten crow.
S29E07_629#It is not bad. Tastes like seagull.
S29E07_632#Chang-stein, I bet you that I can break down
S29E07_636#this loser right here in, oh, 15 seconds.
S29E07_640#Moe, I would like to ask you about your last birthday.
S29E07_643#W-Why? W-What have you heard?
S29E07_645#Did you have a party?
S29E07_646#No, sir.
S29E07_647#- Cake? - No.
S29E07_650#Ah, man, it looks like he's tearing Moe a new one.
S29E07_652#Well, most of his old ones are pretty bad,
S29E07_654#so that could be a good thing.
S29E07_655#So, did you leave your house?
S29E07_656#No.
S29E07_658#Any phone calls?
S29E07_660#- Y-Yes. - Meant for you?
S29E07_661#No!
S29E07_665#I pretended to be someone who was interested
S29E07_668#in carpet cleaning.
S29E07_673#Um, that's time, and he is definitely crying, so you win.
S29E07_677#Bart, you don't want to be with these guys.
S29E07_678#They're monsters.
S29E07_680#Hey, their 401Ks are monsters.
S29E07_683#Do you even know what a 401K is?
S29E07_685#I assume it's a gun.
S29E07_687#Yeah, well, I may not have much,
S29E07_689#but I got some things that matter, huh?
S29E07_691#My bar, my friends, my good name.
S29E07_693#Hear! Hear!
S29E07_695#All right, well, if you believe in your friends so much,
S29E07_698#how about we make a little wager on the match?
S29E07_701#- Uh, oh, can I bet on youse to win? - No.
S29E07_704#Careful, Moe. I got a bad feeling about this.
S29E07_707#Just leave us be, huh?
S29E07_709#All right, how about this? If we win the next two games,
S29E07_712#your bar is ours, and you have to change
S29E07_715#your, uh, good name.
S29E07_717#I got a bad feeling.
S29E07_719#Bad feeling, bad feeling,
S29E07_724#But if I win, I want something I can share with my friends.
S29E07_727#Something only a rich guy like you can give us.
S29E07_729#Let's do this.
S29E07_732#Look at me, Moe Szyslak, shaking hands with a guy
S29E07_735#wearing a shirt worth more than I'll earn in my entire life.
S29E07_739#Ugh, it feels like I'm shaking hands with a squid.
S29E07_742#No, the squid has a much firmer grip.
S29E07_745#Hey, Pin Gals.
S29E07_747#Wha...?
S29E07_750#Hey, hey, hey, we ain't afraid of no bowling shirts.
S29E07_753#They're not shirts; it's compression wear,
S29E07_754#which increases blood flow to our arms
S29E07_756#and decreases wind resistance.
S29E07_759#Oh, yeah!
S29E07_762#They know two-handed bowling.
S29E07_764#Hey, we been hustled!
S29E07_766#Huh, if you can't trust hedge fund guys,
S29E07_767#who can you trust?
S29E07_771#Nice toss.
S29E07_773#Um, nobody likes suck-ups.
S29E07_774#All right? Cheeseburger.
S29E07_778#I want to help you stand up to them.
S29E07_779#But they're traders.
S29E07_781#All we know is how to collect information.
S29E07_783#Everyone has a weak spot.
S29E07_786#We will aggregate their emotional responses
S29E07_789#and run a regression through the data.
S29E07_791#Thanks for dumbing it down for us.
S29E07_793#Polish your balls?
S29E07_795#Man, this alley does everything.
S29E07_797#Oh, I don't work for the alley.
S29E07_800#No, indeed.
S29E07_806#Bart?
S29E07_808#Hey, Mom, I got a question for you.
S29E07_810#- Am I too young to start drinking vodka? - Yes.
S29E07_813#Wish you would've told me that an hour ago.
S29E07_815#Here's a little "Don't tell Homer" money.
S29E07_817#If you love money with all your heart,
S29E07_819#the money will never love you back.
S29E07_821#Will having no money make me happy?
S29E07_824#No.
S29E07_825#Does Bill Gates love his wife?
S29E07_827#Melinda? Of course he does.
S29E07_830#They started a foundation that does wonderful things.
S29E07_833#- With money, right? - Yes.
S29E07_835#So, money's the answer for everything.
S29E07_838#Have a C-note, sweetheart.
S29E07_840#She gets it.
S29E07_848#They really kicked our butts.
S29E07_851#I'm gonna lose my bar and my name.
S29E07_853#No Moe, no tavern, nothing.
S29E07_855#I'm gonna jump into that empty elevator shaft!
S29E07_857#Moe, no!
S29E07_863#I just, uh... I can't win.
S29E07_868#Oh, yeah, now we're getting somewhere.
S29E07_881#All right, we've come to that time--
S29E07_883#the time where I give that inspirational speech
S29E07_886#I've been keeping in my pocket.
S29E07_888#You have given this lonely little man
S29E07_891#a reason to get up every single day,
S29E07_894#and that is why I love youse, Marge.
S29E07_896#I mean, uh, Pin Pals. Pin Pals.
S29E07_899#And we got a secret weapon.
S29E07_901#This guy is sober.
S29E07_903#I am, because of the love of your sister.
S29E07_906#Now, just so you know, that was,
S29E07_907#that was a catfish thing, right?
S29E07_909#What's a "Catfish" thing?
S29E07_911#I'll explain it to you after the match.
S29E07_912#Just don't drink.
S29E07_914#You know how, uh, how Miriam hates it.
S29E07_917#You know, you sister looks just like Jennifer Lawrence.
S29E07_920#And all her pictures say "Getty Images."
S29E07_923#Yeah, that's-that's a problem with your computer.
S29E07_925#Just stay sober, huh?
S29E07_938#Hey, have you ever tasted liquid gold?
S29E07_947#You realize that was a thousand-dollar swallow.
S29E07_952#Return... to me.
S29E07_975#*Yeah.*
S29E07_988#Oh, what do you want?
S29E07_989#Fair warning: 
S29E07_991#we have combed through all the emotional data on you
S29E07_993#to find your soft targets.
S29E07_995#What the hell are you talking about?
S29E07_997#You'll see, in just 15 seconds.
S29E07_1000#Reynolds, artificial intelligence
S29E07_1003#is just three months away from taking your job.
S29E07_1006#Without my job, I... I'm just a douche.
S29E07_1009#You don't know that the other two
S29E07_1011#are sleeping with your wife.
S29E07_1013#I thought you were, but you?!
S29E07_1016#You're all about your BMW,
S29E07_1018#but you couldn't afford the sport package.
S29E07_1023#And I win, just like all good people always win.
S29E07_1027#- McDingus. - Yes, Father?
S29E07_1029#Throw this at your sister.
S29E07_1031#You won't do it, Bart.
S29E07_1033#Why not? It's you and it's me,
S29E07_1035#and it wastes food.
S29E07_1037#You won't do it because, deep down,
S29E07_1039#there's something weird that connects us.
S29E07_1040#You're crazy.
S29E07_1042#Neither of us admits it,
S29E07_1043#but it's there.
S29E07_1045#I hold myself out to you.
S29E07_1048#Go on, make my face the home of the Whopper.
S29E07_1051#I-I can't do it.
S29E07_1053#You do like me. You do!
S29E07_1055#And we'll always keep this burger 
S29E07_1057#as a symbol of our fr...
S29E07_1061#May I wax your alley?
S29E07_1063#Will you get out of here?!
S29E07_1065#All right, this is it, the tenth frame, the final frame.
S29E07_1068#The frame where you start looking for your regular shoes.
S29E07_1073#All right, Barney, just do your thing. No pressure.
S29E07_1074#Here's a picture of my sister
S29E07_1076#in the movie Silver Linings Playbook.
S29E07_1078#Take a look.
S29E07_1080#Hey, you guys liquored him up!
S29E07_1083#Don't worry, Moe, I can still win the spelling bee.
S29E07_1086#"Recidivism."
S29E07_1088#"R"... 
S29E07_1091#Eh, because of this idiot, Homer,
S29E07_1092#we need three strikes from you.
S29E07_1094#I just want to know what it's like to be a winner, huh?
S29E07_1096#Just one time.
S29E07_1098#What about that Women in Film award?
S29E07_1099#No, I stole that.
S29E07_1102#Okay, Moe, for you, I'll do it.
S29E07_1109#We're gonna win. I'm not gonna have to start over again!
S29E07_1115#Because starting over, uh, what would that even mean?
S29E07_1136#That could be my reality.
S29E07_1138#Oh, my God, I got to lose this match.
S29E07_1140#Homer, no!
S29E07_1142#- Give me the ball! - I need it to bowl!
S29E07_1144#I don't want to win!
S29E07_1146#You're the worst coach ever!
S29E07_1148#Just give me the damn ball!
S29E07_1161#What's wrong, Moe?
S29E07_1163#- Yeah, we won. - Nothing. I just got to go back
S29E07_1165#to the worst thing in the world, huh?
S29E07_1167#Being me.
S29E07_1170#The guy you wouldn't even invite to a basketball game.
S29E07_1175#Wha... uh, d-did somebody say "Wait"?
S29E07_1177#- No. - Well, I wouldn't come back now
S29E07_1179#if you begged me.
S29E07_1181#- Wait! - Yeah?
S29E07_1182#Just making a point.
S29E07_1188#Surprise!
S29E07_1191#You guys are my friends.
S29E07_1193#- That's right. - We sure are.
S29E07_1195#And we're gonna have a big party!
S29E07_1197#Right after we get back from the basketball game.
S29E07_1204#Salt of the earth there.
S29E07_1207#Yeah, right guys, since you won a championship,
S29E07_1210#those hedge fund do-rags have to deliver an experience
S29E07_1213#for me and my pals that only they can bring.
S29E07_1215#When does it start?
S29E07_1217#Right about... now.
S29E07_1226#Welcome to how I always feel.
S29E09_10#Happy birthd...!
S29E09_99#*Pickin' up trash*
S29E09_100#*Put it in the bag*
S29E09_102#*Kentucky chicken bucket
S29E09_104#*Put it in the bag*
S29E09_106#*Makin' four cents an hour and free cigarettes*
S29E09_109#*Oh, yeah*
S29E09_113#You have done a beautiful job, ladies.
S29E09_115#I think we're ready to move on.
S29E09_126#Homer!
S29E09_128#I'm awake! I'm awake! What?
S29E09_130#Oh, I wish you hadn't done that.
S29E09_132#Someone adopted this highway.
S29E09_133#Not so loud.
S29E09_135#The highway doesn't know it's adopted.
S29E09_137#But we love it just the same.
S29E09_139#Well, at least you rented an SUV for this trip.
S29E09_142#Now I don't have to clean up the mess.
S29E09_146#I'm starting to get carsick.
S29E09_148#Quick, stick your head out the window!
S29E09_150#No, no, no, no, it's a rental.
S29E09_151#Aim inside and blast away.
S29E09_153#Anyone want a caramel apple?
S29E09_155#- It's a rental. - No, thanks.
S29E09_156#Shave the dog?
S29E09_158#It's a rental.
S29E09_159#Thank you, no.
S29E09_163#Get me candy.
S29E09_168#What's so funny?
S29E09_170#You checked this out with half a tank,
S29E09_171#but now it's three-quarters full.
S29E09_173#I'm callin' you Santa 
S29E09_175#'cause you just gifted us one-quarter tank.
S29E09_179#Nobody, and I mean nobody, calls me Santa.
S29E09_182#What are you doing, Dad?
S29E09_184#I'm gonna burn that quarter tank.
S29E09_186#Wasting gas while sitting on my ass.
S29E09_188#It's the American way.
S29E09_208#Amazing, son!
S29E09_211#Unfortunately, your left foot just grazed the sideline.
S29E09_213#Incomplete pass.
S29E09_215#Dad, I've got to pee.
S29E09_218#I know it's a rental, but I'd rather go in the woods.
S29E09_221#Maybe I should come with you.
S29E09_222#Dad, come on. I'm ten years old.
S29E09_224#I can pee by myself. It's easy.
S29E09_225#You just shake it when you're through.
S29E09_227#You do what now?
S29E09_231#Sketch what you see. 
S29E09_251#Bart, where are you?!
S29E09_253#- Bart! - What is it?
S29E09_255#Bart...!
S29E09_258#Bart!
S29E09_261#I don't know, but I can't shoot it.
S29E09_262#Looks like it's pregnant.
S29E09_263#Ah, let's wait till they're born,
S29E09_265#and then we'll, uh, shoot 'em all.
S29E09_270#Where the heck were you?
S29E09_271#Where's Bart?
S29E09_273#Okay, this is the hardest news in the world for a mother to hear.
S29E09_276#Just ease her into it.
S29E09_279#Um, you know that sewing room you wanted,
S29E09_281#but we could never figure out where?
S29E09_283#Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
S29E09_284#What? My special little guy.
S29E09_285#Don't worry, Lou.
S29E09_287#If there's one thing I've mastered,
S29E09_289#it's consoling distraught parents.
S29E09_292#Ma'am? Ma'am?
S29E09_294#Can you describe your son's skeleton?
S29E09_297#Ooh! You incompetent...
S29E09_299#Look, look, your boy's gonna be fine.
S29E09_300#Now we laid out a grid
S29E09_302#and have search teams fanning out over the forest.
S29E09_308#I'm sorry, but, uh, because of the grid,
S29E09_310#we have to suspend the search and bring in some ambulances.
S29E09_317#Where is my son?!
S29E09_323#Where am I?
S29E09_342#Welcome to Strategic Air Command, Springfield Station.
S29E09_345#If you're watching this tape, half the world is doomed.
S29E09_348#Says you, General Dead Guy.
S29E09_350#Behind you is a Titan II missile,
S29E09_352#key to a mighty line of defense
S29E09_355#that will reduce our casualties to an acceptable 200 million.
S29E09_361#Dud.
S29E09_363#Ay, caramba!
S29E09_366#Bart? Bart!
S29E09_367#Bart! Bart! 
S29E09_368#Bart!
S29E09_371#Now don't worry, I have the best dang bloodhound in the county.
S29E09_374#Uh, does your boy smell like a fox?
S29E09_377#- No. - We're of no use to you.
S29E09_380#Come on, Bart. You made your point!
S29E09_383#The whole town is looking for you.
S29E09_387#Even that scary old man from the house with the broken windows.
S29E09_389#Bart broke my windows!
S29E09_391#It used to be a normal house!
S29E09_394#All right, listen up. We have a boy-comma-missing,
S29E09_397#and you maggots-- you're gonna help find him.
S29E09_399#I thought we were ladies.
S29E09_401#- You're lady maggots. - Now see here, Sergeant.
S29E09_404#You haven't fed us. We're pretty close to riot mode.
S29E09_406#This is the boy.
S29E09_408#Never seen him in my life.
S29E09_413#We all get tattoos we regret.
S29E09_416#I will find that boy,
S29E09_418#and I will toast you with his blood!
S29E09_421#What'd I tell you about blood toasts, Bob?
S29E09_423#To do them, but not brag about them.
S29E09_427#It's not what your country can do for you.
S29E09_431#Ask what you can do for your country.
S29E09_433#Doesn't sound like any president I know.
S29E09_443#Freedom!
S29E09_446#Oh, I can smell Springfield!
S29E09_457#Nothing good ever comes from trying.
S29E09_459#Private Homer,
S29E09_460#you fat stack of mop buckets!
S29E09_462#You find something funny about this?
S29E09_465#How about I wipe that smile off your fat face?
S29E09_468#Not my Homie!
S29E09_469#Avert your eyes, ma'am.
S29E09_472#A phone?! Please.
S29E09_474#Dial tone. Dial tone.
S29E09_477#Oh, thank God!
S29E09_479#I'm looking for a Miss Culls.
S29E09_482#First name Tess, middle initial "T."
S29E09_483#Uh, just a sec. I'll check.
S29E09_486#Uh, Tess T. Culls. Tess T. Culls!
S29E09_489#Uh, come on! I know you're hangin' around here somewhere.
S29E09_493#Why, you little...
S29E09_495#When I catch you, I'm gonna stick a beer tap in ya
S29E09_497#and pull till the foam comes out your ears!
S29E09_505#I give up.
S29E09_507#If you find Bart, give me his lunch money.
S29E09_510#Well, I'm never giving up.
S29E09_511#Why not?
S29E09_513#Because searching forever is much easier
S29E09_516#than me finding a new friend.
S29E09_518#I could be your new friend.
S29E09_520#- What was that? - Nothing.
S29E09_521#Shut up!
S29E09_525#His lucky cap!
S29E09_528#Bart? Bart? Are you down there?
S29E09_531#Milhouse!
S29E09_533#I have never been so glad to see you.
S29E09_536#Thanks for not noticing my new haircut.
S29E09_538#Just give me your phone.
S29E09_542#I'll go get help!
S29E09_543#You can count on me!
S29E09_549#I lit these for our son.
S29E09_551#Marge, honey, he's never gonna come back
S29E09_553#if he thinks it's a church.
S29E09_555#With 78% of the search area reporting,
S29E09_558#Channel Six is now projecting that Bart Simpson is dead.
S29E09_561#That's right. Self-proclaimed underachiever Bart Simpson,
S29E09_564#dead at the age of ten.
S29E09_566#Now let's look at the districts where he's deadest.
S29E09_575#Lisa, I have news about Bart.
S29E09_577#We already know.
S29E09_581#Oh, Milhouse, you were his best friend.
S29E09_586#What did you come here for?
S29E09_589#I came to tell her he's alive,
S29E09_592#but this feels almost as good as hugging Harry Horse.
S29E09_596#I came to comfort you in these uncertain times.
S29E09_600#It's over!
S29E09_602#We're callin' off the search!
S29E09_604#- Did they find him? - No, he's dead.
S29E09_607#No! That can't be.
S29E09_610#Lord, why do you kill things that I want to kill?
S29E09_614#Take me now, vile rake!
S29E09_625#I think you should look at Bart's death this way, Bob.
S29E09_628#You're free. You're totally free.
S29E09_631#Oh, this slipped off.
S29E09_633#Have you ever thought of how your life could've gone
S29E09_636#had you committed to good instead of evil?
S29E09_638#Evil isn't a choice.
S29E09_640#I see.
S29E09_641#Why don't we try a little psychological exercise, Bob?
S29E09_644#If I unshackle you, will you behave?
S29E09_645#Try me.
S29E09_649#Cut out Bart's picture.
S29E09_651#And by so doing, cut him out of your life.
S29E09_655#Don't listen to them, Bob.
S29E09_657#I'm alive.
S29E09_666#Are you okay there, Bob?
S29E09_668#I won't believe he's dead
S29E09_670#until I've made soup from his bones!
S29E09_675#Why do I keep giving them scissors?
S29E09_684#Hello?
S29E09_686#Hey, Mom, it's me. Still married?
S29E09_687#Oh, my God, oh, my God!
S29E09_689#He's alive! And sassy!
S29E09_697#One for the road?
S29E09_700#It's a long road.
S29E09_703#I'll see you soon.
S29E09_708#Hello, Bart...'s friend.
S29E09_711#Bart's alive!
S29E09_712#Lead me to Bart.
S29E09_714#You'll have to kill me first.
S29E09_716#But if you kill me, you'll never find Bart.
S29E09_719#A conundrum.
S29E09_721#How to break you?
S29E09_724#Tell me, do you like light operetta?
S29E09_727#Oh, how light?
S29E09_728#And a-one and a-two.
S29E09_730#*I have a song to sing, O*
S29E09_734#*Sing me your song, O*
S29E09_737#*'Tis sung to the moon by a lovelorn loon*
S29E09_739#*Who fled from the mocking throng, O*
S29E09_742#*The song of the knell of a churchyard bell...*
S29E09_743#I give! I give!
S29E09_745#I'll take you to Bart!
S29E09_746#*He cracked like an egg*
S29E09_748#Please stop!
S29E09_749#*And began to beg*
S29E09_751#You promised.
S29E09_753#*As I sang this song-o*
S29E09_755#*It's a song of a popinjay, bravely born*
S29E09_757#*Who turned up his noble nose with scorn...*
S29E09_760#Can you at least stab me in my ear?
S29E09_762#No.
S29E09_765#Okay, we'll split up and find Bart.
S29E09_767#Thanks for lending this to us, Ned.
S29E09_769#And I'll do the three things that help the most:
S29E09_772#pray, pray, pray.
S29E09_775#What about me?!
S29E09_778#I ain't ridin' in that!
S29E09_780#No, you're pulling it!
S29E09_782#Lousy, no good...
S29E09_784#I couldn't pull you when you were eight!
S29E09_793#Angry dad, wise-ass kid.
S29E09_795#Now, there's a formula that never fails.
S29E09_798#Okay, boys, we're gonna sing a nice little song.
S29E09_800#I want to play cowboys and Indians.
S29E09_802#Calvin, put down that tomahawk.
S29E09_804#Calvin. Calvin.
S29E09_806#Calvin!
S29E09_808#You look funny, Dave.
S29E09_809#Dave? Dave?!
S29E09_811#*God bless America*
S29E09_814#*Give me back my tomahawk...*
S29E09_818#That's where he is. But if you jump down,
S29E09_820#you can't get back up and you'll be caught.
S29E09_822#So, uh, I guess that's checkmate.
S29E09_824#We're not playing chess.
S29E09_826#We're playing a game called After You.
S29E09_828#After me?
S29E09_830#If you insist.
S29E09_835#Oh, god, I'm so sick of these.
S29E09_842#Twelfth time's the charm!
S29E09_844#Sideshow Bob?!
S29E09_846#That's right. I found your hidey-hole!
S29E09_849#You found my heinie hole?
S29E09_851#Ah, yes.
S29E09_853#Always the back-of-the-class wit.
S29E09_855#Well, today you're going to be a real blast.
S29E09_859#I don't like the way he really hit the word "Blast."
S29E09_868#Uh, Bob, it takes two keys.
S29E09_871#That way, no nutcase can do it by himself.
S29E09_873#Well, no one ever said launching two boys
S29E09_875#on a 50-year-old missile would be easy.
S29E09_878#Wow! For a 50-year-old missile, it's in terrific shape!
S29E09_881#Shut up!
S29E09_883#I'm a kid who appreciates things that last.
S29E09_889#Come on, boy. Get a good whiff of his scent.
S29E09_907#Did you find anything?
S29E09_909#We found Bart's sock drawer.
S29E09_911#Get back out here!
S29E09_913#Well, you can't shoot her. You know that's a woman.
S29E09_916#Oh, this is the last time I hunt with my lawyer.
S29E09_918#Son, I can't go no further.
S29E09_920#I want to just lie down and die.
S29E09_922#Dad, you can't die here.
S29E09_923#You have to die in a nursing home,
S29E09_925#where your body falls apart as you burn through your savings
S29E09_927#till you're a worthless vegetable.
S29E09_929#You know, with dignity.
S29E09_931#You're right, son. We're here on a mission.
S29E09_933#Now, let's pick out that Christmas tree.
S29E09_935#We're here to find Bart.
S29E09_937#Right, right. But we got a nice eight-footer over here.
S29E09_941#She's got a bare patch, but we'll turn that to the wall.
S29E09_944#That's it. I'm not listening to another word.
S29E09_946#Help! Help! Help!
S29E09_950#For this, you can thank my time
S29E09_953#at Cirque du Soleil.
S29E09_955#More like Cirque du So Lame.
S29E09_957#Yes, they are pretty much all the same.
S29E09_960#Just a little further...
S29E09_963#Oh, wait, wrong key.
S29E09_968#Five minutes to launch.
S29E09_977#Bob, why are you doing this?
S29E09_980#Well, it's perfectly obvious.
S29E09_981#Uh, it's...
S29E09_983#Give me a moment.
S29E09_984#It's an ICBM.
S29E09_986#I Commit Bart's Murder!
S29E09_988#That's your justification for killing two kids?
S29E09_991#I...
S29E09_993#Dad, look! It's either Sideshow Bob or Shaq.
S29E09_996#Not me. I'm going that way.
S29E09_998#Boy, am I lost.
S29E09_1000#Shaq, can you help us?
S29E09_1001#I'm not Superman.
S29E09_1003#You have a Superman tattoo on your arm.
S29E09_1004#How do you know so much about me?
S29E09_1006#You're scaring me. I don't have any money.
S29E09_1014#Have you ever thought of how your life could've gone
S29E09_1016#had you committed to good?
S29E09_1017#It is true. I had talent.
S29E09_1019#I was on Zoom. Just send it to Zoom!
S29E09_1022#Box 350, Boston, Mass.
S29E09_1026#You don't want to do this. You're losing it, Bob.
S29E09_1029#I don't know what's real and what's hallucination.
S29E09_1042#Hello? Hello, Doctor. Bob Terwilliger.
S29E09_1044#Did I catch you at a bad time?
S29E09_1046#Oh, Bob, how thoughtful of you to call.
S29E09_1048#Most prisoners rarely follow up after leaving me to die.
S29E09_1052#I just need to know,
S29E09_1054#should I kill these children?
S29E09_1056#Sounds like someone's got a case of the shoulds.
S29E09_1057#If you're calling to ask,
S29E09_1059#it means you already know the answer.
S29E09_1061#T minus two minutes.
S29E09_1062#Clear blast area.
S29E09_1064#Just tell me, please!
S29E09_1066#He's not allowed to talk.
S29E09_1080#that sounds like the ignition sequence
S29E09_1083#of an LGM-25C Titan II-II ballistic missile.
S29E09_1086#I've had just about enough of your nonsense!
S29E09_1090#All right, I owe you one.
S29E09_1093#So, why'd you save us?
S29E09_1095#Because I realized I don't want to kill you anymore.
S29E09_1099#Milhouse, is there a knife in my back?
S29E09_1101#Not that I can see.
S29E09_1103#Milhouse, is there a "Kick me" sign on my back?
S29E09_1106#Not that I can see.
S29E09_1110#I just can't get a clean shot.
S29E09_1113#Also, you don't have a gun.
S29E09_1115#I'm useless, all right.
S29E09_1119#What a brilliant conceptual piece.
S29E09_1120#Who's it by?
S29E09_1122#"Norad."
S29E09_1124#More like Snore-ad.
S29E09_1126#Wait, is it ticking?
S29E09_1132#Sooner or later,
S29E09_1134#it all comes down to mopping.
S29E09_1144#Doctor, I'm happy.
S29E09_1145#And when I'm released,
S29E09_1147#after three consecutive life sentences,
S29E09_1149#I think I'll open a flower shop.
S29E09_1151#Oh, that's great, Bob.
S29E09_1153#Not all my patients are this successful.
S29E09_1156#I won't be needing his file anymore.
S29E09_1157#And if you're interested, 
S29E09_1159#tomorrow's 9:00 appointment just opened up.
S29E09_1162#And 10:00.
S29E09_1176#Your New York Magazine, sir.
S29E09_1178#This is The New Yorker. Totally different.
S29E09_1180#One is the gossip rag of the glitterati.
S29E09_1182#The other, an asthmatic dinosaur that hasn't been relevant
S29E09_1185#since William Shawn breathed his last!
S29E09_1188#Can I go now? I've got 15 other lighthouses,
S29E09_1190#and every one's a weirdo.
S29E09_1191#Not that you are.
S29E09_1193#Fine. Leave me. I'll just polish the bulb
S29E09_1196#and ponder a wasted life as I walk along the shore.
S29E09_1200#I rewrite it every time the tide goes out.
S29E09_1202#Listen to me!
S29E09_1204#Life is short.
S29E09_1206#Don't spend it on foolish, empty revenge!
S29E09_1209#If you buy a mailbox, I wouldn't have to talk to you anymore.
S29E09_1211#Fine.

S29E10_62#Kang-a-roo meat*
S29E10_64#*Traffic suffers from paralysis*
S29E10_69#Please. I'm late for my dialysis.
S29E10_72#*It's another Springfield day*
S29E10_76#*I¡¯m too sad to say ol¨¦*
S29E10_80#*We've lost our coolest gays*
S29E10_84#Duffman thinks this town's okay!
S29E10_88#*It's another Springfield day*
S29E10_94#Lenny's a survivor!
S29E10_96#*This will be a perfect day*
S29E10_98#*No way to go outside and play*
S29E10_100#*And so we're on our way*
S29E10_102#*To a very nerdy science conference*
S29E10_107#Take it Bart!
S29E10_108#If you're givin' it, I don't want it.
S29E10_110#Bring it home, boy.
S29E10_112#*My sister sucks*
S29E10_116#Nyah, nyah.
S29E10_118#*It's another perfect day*
S29E10_122#I brought my stems.
S29E10_124#Sir, this is a conference of Science, 
S29E10_126#Technology, Engineering and Math.
S29E10_128#What about this one?
S29E10_130#Dialogue on Pediatric Education.
S29E10_136#I find this claim highly doyvik.
S29E10_139#It's all true according to the highly-prestigious
S29E10_141#Institute for Purchased Science.
S29E10_143#Here's our top scientist now.
S29E10_145#Sir, I-I don't think this is fooling anyone.
S29E10_148#Quiet! And put on the monocle, Professor Noodle-Strudel.
S29E10_153#- So where's your booth? - I don't have one.
S29E10_155#- I just came here for fun. - Fun?!
S29E10_157#One child, please.
S29E10_159#I was here first.
S29E10_161#If disco's dead, I don't want to live.
S29E10_164#It's Stuicide!
S29E10_166#Self-unrolling yoga mats.
S29E10_171#Artificial intelligence that writes TV recaps.
S29E10_175#Stranger Things suffers from season two fatigue.
S29E10_179#And look! IMAX Al Gore!
S29E10_183#If every family could just reduce their carbon footprint
S29E10_185#by ten percent...
S29E10_187#it's hopeless.
S29E10_188#The floods are comin', people!
S29E10_191#This is my Woodstock!
S29E10_196#You okay, honey?
S29E10_197#It's fine. It's fine.
S29E10_199#I'm just intellectually drunk.
S29E10_202#I guess that's okay.
S29E10_204#Marge, Marge, Marge, you lighten up.
S29E10_205#It's science.
S29E10_207#Maybe you should sit down.
S29E10_209#I ain't sittin'. I'm ready to fly!
S29E10_218#Hey, kid, I want to show you something.
S29E10_220#Are you a pervert?
S29E10_222#No. A chemical engineer.
S29E10_224#No!
S29E10_226#I used to be like you.
S29E10_227#You mean incredibly bored?
S29E10_229#Oh, let's see if you think this is boring.
S29E10_232#I drop a little water on powdered sodium...
S29E10_237#Listen, I don't know what you're teaching,
S29E10_239#but you and I have great chemistry.
S29E10_241#Except for the lab coat.
S29E10_242#It makes you look kind of heavy.
S29E10_244#I actually am kind of heavy, and it makes me look thinner!
S29E10_248#I don't know what could make this day more perfect.
S29E10_260#You didn't applaud. Nothing.
S29E10_261#Here, I'll show ya how it goes.
S29E10_265#Thank you. No selfies.
S29E10_267#In a lesser musician, 
S29E10_270#that boy's attitude would be needy masquerading as arrogance.
S29E10_272#I'm leaving if he can't sing.
S29E10_275#*I¡¯ve had my share of crazy flings*
S29E10_277#*But they all end up leavin*
S29E10_281#*And leavin', well, it really stings*
S29E10_284#Oh, God. He's one small step away
S29E10_286#from destroying all my logic and reason.
S29E10_294#Hey, Lisa.
S29E10_297#I brought you three waters: cold, lukewarm and warm.
S29E10_300#- That's nice. Any sparkling? - Damn it!
S29E10_304#Hi, I'm Lisa Simpson,
S29E10_306#and I'm nervous about saying anything 
S29E10_308#that will ruin this perfect moment.
S29E10_309#My name's Brendan.
S29E10_311#Oh, good, good. No last names.
S29E10_313#Don't want things moving too fast.
S29E10_316#I hope our children get his hair.
S29E10_319#Now to subtly find out how old he is.
S29E10_320#How old are you?
S29E10_322#Well, I'm 11, but I'm insouciant at a 12th grade level,
S29E10_325#and I'm talented, too.
S29E10_326#So unfair, right?
S29E10_328#That's amazing, because the boys I know are re...
S29E10_331#I've got sparkling!
S29E10_333#Sorry, I'm not thirsty anymore.
S29E10_334#Damn it!
S29E10_336#Um, so w-where do you go to school?
S29E10_339#I just moved here. I'm starting next week
S29E10_341#at a school called Springfield Elementary.
S29E10_343#I see it got a few dreadful reviews on Yelp.
S29E10_345#This guy called "Gary Chalmers" gave it half a star.
S29E10_347#Bloody hell!
S29E10_348#Of all the K through sixes in this world,
S29E10_351#you had to walk into mine.
S29E10_354#A beautiful hotel bar! Just like in The Shining!
S29E10_357#Oh, hi, lee...tle girl.
S29E10_359#If you see your ma... uh, ma wife,
S29E10_363#tell her Homer-- not your dad-- wants the credit card.
S29E10_366#I will... sir.
S29E10_368#- Sir? I'm your dad. - D'oh!
S29E10_370#Today, we are performing
S29E10_372#an experiment that we humorously call
S29E10_374#"Making elephant toothpaste."
S29E10_377#Boy, the Germans sure know their humor.
S29E10_380#Let's just hope they know something about chemistry.
S29E10_383#First, add a tablespoon of dish soap to hydrogen peroxide,
S29E10_387#then add the warm water and the yeast!
S29E10_395#German chemistry!
S29E10_408#Sounds great, Lisa. Really great.
S29E10_410#You're just a little behind the beat.
S29E10_412#Maybe you're a little ahead?
S29E10_415#you're so cute when you're wrong.
S29E10_418#- Channel that rage! - No!
S29E10_420#Make that reed pay for my sins!
S29E10_424#Yeah!
S29E10_427#Knock off that racket!
S29E10_429#It's not a racket!
S29E10_431#It's the truest American art form!
S29E10_434#Banging on the walls is the truest American art form,
S29E10_437#and I'm a Picasso!
S29E10_440#Oh, no! They're playing in time to the beat of my banging!
S29E10_443#Well, then stop banging.
S29E10_446#I can't. The rhythm is infectious.
S29E10_458#Here's the school trophy case.
S29E10_460#If you look closely, it's empty.
S29E10_462#They're actually decals on the glass.
S29E10_466#Oh, hello, Lisa.
S29E10_468#I see you have a new friend.
S29E10_470#Brendan, this is Nelson.
S29E10_473#Lisa, you sure know a lot of weird guys.
S29E10_475#Hello, Brenda.
S29E10_477#Excuse me. Why is being a girl an insult?
S29E10_479#Ah! So evolved!
S29E10_481#Lisa, are you squishy for this ding-dong?
S29E10_484#Lisa, does that fat kid like you?
S29E10_489#Whatever we had, it's in the past.
S29E10_494#I think there's something in the water in this town.
S29E10_505#Oh, man.
S29E10_507#*On a playground I tripped*
S29E10_510#*Then I saw you and flipped*
S29E10_513#He used "Flipped" with a double meaning!
S29E10_514#Bastard!
S29E10_516#*Now I'm skippin'*
S29E10_518#*And trippin' for you*
S29E10_521#He turned his suffering into entertainment,
S29E10_524#just like the Jewish people!
S29E10_526#Nothing can ruin this moment.
S29E10_528#Make way. Dead gophers.
S29E10_529#Nothing!
S29E10_534#How can you be sleeping?!
S29E10_539#Oh, thank God.
S29E10_542#Meanwhile, Bart's teacher says he has a flair for chemistry.
S29E10_545#Why that little...
S29E10_547#Wait. Flair? Isn't that a good thing?
S29E10_550#Yes. It's too good.
S29E10_558#Why don't you ask him what he's up to?
S29E10_561#Because if he lies to me, it's like a dagger in my heart.
S29E10_564#What happens when-- I mean if-- I ever lie to you?
S29E10_567#Can you find out what he's really up to?
S29E10_569#- I will. - See? That's a lie right there.
S29E10_572#Okay, I really will.
S29E10_573#That's also a lie.
S29E10_576#Fine. I really, really, really will.
S29E10_578#Finally, the truth.
S29E10_582#Keeping... promise.
S29E10_585#Stupid tree house.
S29E10_587#So far off the ground.
S29E10_590#Uh, Dad, you haven't even started to climb yet.
S29E10_593#I have to visualize it first.
S29E10_598#Thanks, guys.
S29E10_599#Ah, no problem.
S29E10_601#Why did we do that, Chief?
S29E10_603#Fat man courtesy, Lou.
S29E10_604#Fat man courtesy.
S29E10_607#Son, how do I put this?
S29E10_609#Are you breaking bad up here?
S29E10_611#No, I'm not.
S29E10_613#And if you're looking for meth, go see Cletus.
S29E10_614#What?!
S29E10_617#Meth Life, 
S29E10_620#proud sponsor of the 2020 Opioid Olympics!
S29E10_624#Ooh, that's street ready!
S29E10_627#Dad, I'm just trying to follow in your footsteps.
S29E10_630#You work in science, and I think that's really cool.
S29E10_633#You've never said that to me before.
S29E10_635#Do you want to go to work with me today?
S29E10_637#You can help me research my theory
S29E10_639#that the chairs can go flat.
S29E10_641#I'd like to, but I've got to do some colloidal titration.
S29E10_647#Marge, it's worse than we thought.
S29E10_648#He's speaking in tongues.
S29E10_650#He's a religious weirdo.
S29E10_651#The worst thing there is.
S29E10_653#Cover your eyes, boys--
S29E10_656#I'm about to flip Mr. Simpson the "Flanders finger."
S29E10_658#You mean...
S29E10_661#Yup-- a thumbs-up without a friendly wink.
S29E10_667#You have a credit card?
S29E10_669#Yeah, but no money.
S29E10_671#Oh, a true jazz musician.
S29E10_692#Just give the ice cream back.
S29E10_696#No way. It was really hard to scoop.
S29E10_702#Prepare to have your ears belted.
S29E10_707#*My funny valentine*
S29E10_710#*Sweet, comic valentine*
S29E10_713#Nelson?
S29E10_715#*You make me smile*
S29E10_717#*With my heart*
S29E10_722#Stop! Why are you doing this?
S29E10_724#I don't know. There's no good word for what I feel.
S29E10_727#Scared and excited at the same time.
S29E10_730#There is a word: vulnerable.
S29E10_732#"Vulner-able"?
S29E10_736#Yup. I always liked you,
S29E10_738#but now I'm seeing you in a new light.
S29E10_745#*Your looks are laughable*
S29E10_749#*Unphotographable*
S29E10_753#*But you're my favorite*
S29E10_756#*Work of art*
S29E10_757#*Art*
S29E10_758#*Art*
S29E10_759#*Art*
S29E10_760#Nailed it.
S29E10_766#And so now there's a jazz war over me.
S29E10_769#It's pretty bad. But it's pretty great.
S29E10_772#Uh-huh. Scotland once had two queens fightin' over her.
S29E10_775#Loser got Scotland.
S29E10_777#Of course, Brendan is the superior artist.
S29E10_778#But that kind of intimidates me.
S29E10_780#And Nelson's rough, but he's sweet.
S29E10_781#Plus he thinks I have dimples.
S29E10_783#Dimples? It's that serious?
S29E10_786#- Aye. - Let me give ye advice on love.
S29E10_788#The Scottish national flower is the thistle.
S29E10_791#A humble weed. Legend has it
S29E10_793#that the Norse King Haakon
S29E10_795#staged a surprise invasion.
S29E10_798#But his barefooted army stepped on thistles,
S29E10_801#and their screams awakened the sleepy Scots.
S29E10_806#Many a Norwegian lass lamented their dead lover
S29E10_809#- on that glorious day. - Willie,
S29E10_812#someone spiked the teachers' vodka with sulfuric acid.
S29E10_815#Superintendent Chalmers lost the tip of his tongue.
S29E10_817#Skin-ner!
S29E10_821#Lisa, this is a song about you.
S29E10_822#A kid who's almost there.
S29E10_825#And when you get there, you'll blow the roof off.
S29E10_834#Yeah, well, I brought my washboard.
S29E10_840#Nelson. You took our washboard.
S29E10_843#I got thongs to scrub.
S29E10_846#I really can't believe
S29E10_848#that this is a choice.
S29E10_849#I mean, look at me.
S29E10_850#And look at him.
S29E10_852#And then look back at me.
S29E10_856#They're quiet.
S29E10_857#Too quiet.
S29E10_861#Now they're loud.
S29E10_862#Too loud.
S29E10_865#Now they're just right.
S29E10_867#Too just right.
S29E10_869#Are you sure Bart's not planning anything?
S29E10_871#A boy takes his cues from his mother.
S29E10_873#If I trust him, then he'll be good.
S29E10_876#Hey, don't knock my mother's method--
S29E10_878#complete abandonment from age five.
S29E10_884#The school talent show.
S29E10_886#And on the back, chemical equations.
S29E10_888#Still think he's innocent?
S29E10_890#We'll just have to go there and see.
S29E10_895#You wanted rock candy, you got rock candy.
S29E10_899#Brendan and Nelson are fighting.
S29E10_902#I'm getting Daddy's gun to under-arrest them.
S29E10_904#Oh, no.
S29E10_906#I'm gonna call you decrescendo,
S29E10_908#'cause you're goin' down.
S29E10_910#Nelson, that's clever.
S29E10_913#Thanks. For you, I read a book.
S29E10_917#All right, Ralphie, easy, easy.
S29E10_919#Give Daddy back his hat.
S29E10_923#Oh, you missed everything, just like Daddy.
S29E10_930#Ugh, so many clams.
S29E10_933#Well, you're gonna look very nice for the show tonight.
S29E10_936#It doesn't matter how I look, I'm not ready.
S29E10_939#I've been so distracted by those boys.
S29E10_940#How did you choose Dad?
S29E10_942#And never regret it?
S29E10_944#Marge, I might've swallowed
S29E10_946#a couple of your earrings.
S29E10_949#Gotta go.
S29E10_955#I do not want to know how you got these back.
S29E10_958#So, we're really doing it.
S29E10_960#We're going to a talent show
S29E10_962#where Bart is putting on a chemistry demonstration.
S29E10_965#Have I got that right?
S29E10_967#If our faces get melted off today,
S29E10_969#I want the last thing Bart sees
S29E10_971#to be us believing in him.
S29E10_973#Fine, fine. Let me just finish my will.
S29E10_979#And...
S29E10_982#Oh, it's good to have that taken care of.
S29E10_990#Nelson? A word?
S29E10_991#Take five, Martin.
S29E10_992#I'm not even in your act.
S29E10_994#I said take five.
S29E10_998#Nelson, I cherish our unhealthy relationship.
S29E10_1001#Especially the fact that I can tell you the truth.
S29E10_1004#Kiddo, you're not a singer.
S29E10_1006#Okay, fine, I won't sing.
S29E10_1007#But I'll still perform.
S29E10_1010#That's how much I want to hold your stupid hand.
S29E10_1013#You're up, Nelson.
S29E10_1018#Hello.
S29E10_1020#I'm the school bully.
S29E10_1023#Aw, don't be a dingus.
S29E10_1025#I'm the next Charlie Mingus.
S29E10_1028#Could I really choose him?
S29E10_1047#My choice is clear: Brendan.
S29E10_1050#Ooh, yeah, I feel the groove.
S29E10_1055#Next contestant, Brendan Beiderbecke.
S29E10_1061#And Brendan wins!
S29E10_1062#Not so fast.
S29E10_1064#We have a disqualification.
S29E10_1066#This young man does not live in the district.
S29E10_1069#Right, his home is 50 feet into West Springfield,
S29E10_1072#which means he will be transferred to a school
S29E10_1074#three buses and a long bike ride away from here.
S29E10_1077#- Brendan... - No, Lisa.
S29E10_1079#I can't put you through that.
S29E10_1081#I guess this relationship is over
S29E10_1083#until this town invests in mass transit.
S29E10_1089#I'll never see him again.
S29E10_1093#Lisa, I'm glad you didn't choose me.
S29E10_1095#No woman is worth learning music.
S29E10_1097#All this time I've been choosing jazz
S29E10_1099#over doing my reps.
S29E10_1101#Well, my reps never let me down.
S29E10_1103#Lift weights, get dates.
S29E10_1105#Lift weights, get dates.
S29E10_1108#Well, I guess I'm alone for the moment.
S29E10_1110#And I like it.
S29E10_1112#- Good for Lisa. - She's better off alone.
S29E10_1113#She doesn't need a man.
S29E10_1115#Wait a minute, everybody. 
S29E10_1116#Even though the most interesting 
S29E10_1118#and emotionally compelling part is over, 
S29E10_1121#we still have one performer who says he will "Blow you away."
S29E10_1125#So please welcome the original Dennis the Chemist,
S29E10_1127#Bart Simpson.
S29E10_1136#Drop the beaker, Screwy Pasteur.
S29E10_1139#No. I wasn't doing anything bad.
S29E10_1142#Pour the beaker and you'll see.
S29E10_1144#We are not gonna let you mix those chemicals.
S29E10_1147#We got a tip from an anonymous source
S29E10_1148#named Seymour Skinner.
S29E10_1150#Do you even know what "Anonymous" Means?
S29E10_1153#Uh, helpful?
S29E10_1155#Mom, I'm innocent.
S29E10_1157#You believe me, don't you?
S29E10_1159#Oh, if he's lying, I'll never forgive him.
S29E10_1162#If he's telling the truth, he'll never forgive me.
S29E10_1165#Glad I'm not you.
S29E10_1168#Bart, sweetie, I'll pour the beaker for you.
S29E10_1190#He's innocent. But then who put the sulfuric acid
S29E10_1193#in Superintendent Chalmers' drink?
S29E10_1194#I did.
S29E10_1196#- Willie! Why? -Why?
S29E10_1198#Because, Seymour, I was trying to kill you.
S29E10_1201#Well, that's okay. Good man.

S29E10_1205#The man's got a dream.
S29E10_1209#I never doubted you.
S29E10_1211#Well, you should have.
S29E10_1228#I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
S29E10_1231#This episode was supposed to have been a parody of Moonlight, 
S29E10_1234#not La La Land.
S29E10_1236#Moonlight? But none of us have seen it.
S29E10_1238#We have the DVD. We could watch it tonight.
S29E10_1240#Either that or X-Men: Apocalypse.
S29E10_1242#X-Men!
S29E10_1244#I'd like to see Moonlight.

S29E11_32#And here's the baby. 
S29E11_34#I know how to hold one of these.
S29E11_52#You're watching The Learning Network,

S29E11_54#Stay tuned for...
S29E11_63#But first...
S29E11_65#The man who saw the future.
S29E11_70#The following film, made in 1982,
S29E11_73#was thought to be lost forever.
S29E11_75#Actually, it was misplaced in a box
S29E11_77#for the comedy Doctor Detroit.
S29E11_80#But its predictions are more terrifying than ever.
S29E11_83#Hello, I'm Orson... Welles,
S29E11_86#director of Citizen Kane...
S29E11_87#Boring.
S29E11_89#...as well as the lower left-hand square
S29E11_90#on Hollywood Squares.
S29E11_92#Ooh, right next to Ruth Buzzi.
S29E11_95#In 1555, the prophet Nostradamus
S29E11_98#foretold a terrifying series of predictions,
S29E11_101#all of which came to pass.
S29E11_103#First, his own death.
S29E11_105# Second, large wars in Europe,
S29E11_108#similar to the large wars he observed in Europe.
S29E11_111#And the breakup of Fleetwood Mac.
S29E11_114#But Nostradamus's final quatrain contained
S29E11_117#one more prediction yet to come:
S29E11_120#that shortly after the Antichrist becomes president...
S29E11_129#This champagne is terrible.
S29E11_131#It tastes like dryer sheets.
S29E11_133#But what does said mushroom signify?
S29E11_137#Nothing less than World War III.
S29E11_140#Ugh, who'd fall for this malarkey?
S29E11_142#Smithers, I'm scared.
S29E11_144#Release the comforting hounds.
S29E11_148#Oh, excellent. Now, make them into rugs.
S29E11_152#Anyone left alive will surely find themselves envying...
S29E11_155#Who? Who could we possibly envy?
S29E11_157#...the dead.
S29E11_159#Smithers, the end is nigh, and we must prepare.
S29E11_162#Round up this town's greatest minds.
S29E11_164#Should I order pizza?

S29E11_170#Attention, fellow members
S29E11_173#of the Springfield chapter of Mensa.
S29E11_176#Mr. Burns has called us here
S29E11_179#to solve an unknown problem of global importance.
S29E11_182#But first, Tri-Ominoes!
S29E11_185#I say we write and solve our own acrostics.
S29E11_187#Yes, after we recite all the words
S29E11_189#in the Declaration of Independence
S29E11_190#in alphabetical order.
S29E11_193#A A A A A A 
S29E11_196#Abdicated. Abolish. Abolishing.
S29E11_199#Absolute. Absolved.
S29E11_201#Silence, you thinkertons.
S29E11_203#I summoned you here because the world is about to end.
S29E11_205#No, it isn't. What are you afraid of?
S29E11_207#Global warming?
S29E11_210#A.I.? Some sort of plague?
S29E11_215#As smarty-pantalones, I am asking you to help with
S29E11_218#the Montgomery Burns Doomsday Ark.
S29E11_221#This space vehicle will lead humanity's best and brightest
S29E11_223#to a better life under my stern rule.
S29E11_226#Oh, gee heavens.
S29E11_229#Will there be someone for your more personal needs?
S29E11_231#Concubines. Many concubines.
S29E11_233#I'll work my way in.
S29E11_235#I need you to tell me who is worthy
S29E11_237#of surviving the apocalypse with me.
S29E11_240#I only want the sharpest razors in this town's Halloween candy.
S29E11_243#Oh, don't worry, Mr. Burns, this is what Mensa does best--
S29E11_246#make everyone else feel stupid.
S29E11_248#The only word in English
S29E11_250#with three consecutive double letters is...
S29E11_252#Um, "Gooseberry."
S29E11_254#No, "Coffee." Coffee-oo.
S29E11_256#- Uh, balloon-an-ing. - Bookkeeper.
S29E11_258#Damn it. 
S29E11_260#It's simple. All we need to do is
S29E11_262#give everyone in town an IQ test.
S29E11_265#The highest scores get on the ark--
S29E11_266#Mensa members grandfathered in.
S29E11_268#Sounds good to me.
S29E11_269#Grandfathered!
S29E11_271#Not so fast. Flavin.
S29E11_273#Being intelligent people, 
S29E11_275#I am quite sure that you will take this well.
S29E11_278#IQs are meaningless.
S29E11_279#Heresy!
S29E11_281#I have the ultimate test
S29E11_283#that measures something far more significant:
S29E11_286#your overall worth as a human.
S29E11_289#Impossible.
S29E11_291#Intelligence is the only quotient
S29E11_293#that tells you how important you are.
S29E11_295#Ask any of us who did well on a test we took when we were six.
S29E11_301#Well, you may be the brightest, but you are not the best.
S29E11_305#Your worthiness as a human being is best measured, people,
S29E11_309#by the Personal Value Quotient. That's P.V.Q.
S29E11_312#All right, enough with the pelting
S29E11_314#and the bonking and the compass in my neck.
S29E11_316#Garvik. In order to defuse
S29E11_317#your obvious hostilities,
S29E11_319#I will make my presentation entertaining, all right?
S29E11_323#With a one, and a two, and a 3.14159.
S29E11_327#Forgive me if it seems like I'm attacking,
S29E11_330#but I find the old IQ test badly lacking.
S29E11_333#If you want to find out just what someone can do,
S29E11_338#*you need to learn that subject's P.V.Q.*
S29E11_343#*It tests for*
S29E11_347#*sympathy and empathy and group collaboration*
S29E11_350#*Artistry and neatness and complex socialization*
S29E11_354#*And every single aspect of a personality*
S29E11_357#*Hey, the P.V.Q.*
S29E11_359#*Is A.O.K. with me*
S29E11_366#*It tests for sarcasm and prudence* 
S29E11_369#*Not if you're Isaac Newton*
S29E11_370#*Confidence, ambition*
S29E11_372#*And the teams for whom you're rootin'*
S29E11_374#*So it's all the little foibles*
S29E11_376#*That can make a person whole*
S29E11_378#*Trust the P.V.Q.*
S29E11_380#*The yardstick for the soul*
S29E11_391#*Now, people, you're all geniuses*
S29E11_393#- Oh, please... - My, my, well, thank you.
S29E11_395#*You can see this is no lark*
S29E11_398#*Emotional intelligence is needed for the ark*
S29E11_410#*You mean earnestness and ego*
S29E11_412#*And if they make a mean burrito*
S29E11_414#*And the social grace to know*
S29E11_416#*When not to wear a Speedo*
S29E11_417#*Every trait that integrates a winning personality*
S29E11_421#*Yes, the P.V.Q.*
S29E11_424#*Is what we'll do to find out who*
S29E11_427#*Will see us through*
S29E11_429#*Yes, the P.V.Q.*
S29E11_431#*Is A.O.K.*
S29E11_435#*With me...*
S29E11_438#Oivik!
S29E11_440#Anyone have a song in rebuttal?
S29E11_442#*You've got to have a heart...*
S29E11_444#Oh, balderdash.
S29E11_446#We're going with this man's test.
S29E11_448#- Oh, wonderful. - To determine who is worthy
S29E11_450#of a seat on my ark.
S29E11_452#Uh, but, sir, how do we get everyone in town
S29E11_454#to take a test without telling them what it's about?
S29E11_458#Mandatory test.
S29E11_460#Mandatory test!
S29E11_462#Mandatory for everyone not ringing a bell.
S29E11_468#What's the point of this test again?
S29E11_469#The way I look at it, the more things
S29E11_471#secret corporations know about us, the better, huh?
S29E11_473#I like when drones show up bringing me things
S29E11_475#I needed but didn't know.
S29E11_479#Wow, I am out of deodorant.
S29E11_480#We all knew.
S29E11_482#Remove all stray marks.
S29E11_484#Number two pencil only.
S29E11_486#And for God's sake, relax!
S29E11_489#This question asks about the price of underwear,
S29E11_491#as if I were some landed aristocrat.
S29E11_494#Hey, can I copy off you?
S29E11_495#Be my guest.
S29E11_501#"Day is to night as early is to..."
S29E11_505#Late. Booyah!
S29E11_509#Booyah!
S29E11_513#Booyah!
S29E11_518#The one test I don't bring my earmuffs.
S29E11_521#The results are in.
S29E11_522#The newest and most accurate measure
S29E11_525#of our intelligence on a scale from one to 500--
S29E11_527#500 being best.
S29E11_529#- Boring. - Don't shut it off.
S29E11_531#I need my score.
S29E11_535#Thank you.
S29E11_537#Now we'll run everyone's scores past the screen really fast,
S29E11_538#from best to worst, 
S29E11_540#trusting that you'll pause at only your name.
S29E11_543#Pause it!
S29E11_547#475, my sweet spot. Excellent.
S29E11_550#But room to improve.
S29E11_554#What?! I am one below Ralph? Ralph?
S29E11_557#Honey, it doesn't mean Ralph's smarter than you.
S29E11_560#It just means he's a more valuable person.
S29E11_563#- Ralph? - Keep scrolling.
S29E11_567#Ooh, 311.
S29E11_569#Above average, but not enough to make people mad.
S29E11_573#And, it's the number you call to complain about potholes.
S29E11_576#Ooh. "H. Simpson: 265."
S29E11_579#Exactly the number of days in a year.
S29E11_582#Well, that's good. Let's change the channel.
S29E11_584#But we don't know your score.
S29E11_586#Like I said, that's good.
S29E11_589#Hmm, not there. Not there. Not there.
S29E11_602#I don't need any test.
S29E11_603#I'm street-smart.
S29E11_611#I refuse to accept that my little guy has no future.
S29E11_614#He can learn how to put in adding machine tape.
S29E11_616#That's how I got through the Depression,
S29E11_618#and letting the FBI know which bugle boys
S29E11_620#were about to turn boogie-woogie.
S29E11_622#We're not giving up on Bart.
S29E11_624#And I'm not giving up on you, Homer.
S29E11_626#What, you're still trying? In what way?
S29E11_628#My will is 38 pages of me yelling at you.
S29E11_631#Ooh, I'm in the will.
S29E11_637#Charles. Listen to me, Charles.
S29E11_638#Not now, Satan.
S29E11_640#I'm not Satan, I'm Orson Welles.
S29E11_643#Satan would sell wine before its time.
S29E11_646#Yes. Now, have you taken my warning seriously?
S29E11_649#Oh, but I did. I've already started the ark.
S29E11_651#Very good. Now I must go.
S29E11_653#God commissioned me to direct a rainbow,
S29E11_656#and I've spent half my budget on indigo.
S29E11_658#The only answer is to play "Red" Myself.
S29E11_660#Smithers. Speed up production on the ark.
S29E11_662#Put everyone on it.
S29E11_664#Ply them with all the rum and salt it takes.
S29E11_674#Eh, there's no nap like a scaffold nap.
S29E11_678#Hey, what do you think we're building, anyway?
S29E11_680#I'm betting it's a new Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
S29E11_682#Maybe this one will keep somebody out.
S29E11_686#How can Ralph score higher than me?
S29E11_688#That's-that's just wrong.
S29E11_690#But all my self-esteem comes from tests.
S29E11_693#Should I really be pulling on this string?
S29E11_696#I am not worse than Ralph!
S29E11_701#- Hi, Ralph. - Hi, Ralph.
S29E11_702#Hi, Ralph.
S29E11_703#Hi, Ralph.
S29E11_705#I miss the string through my ears.
S29E11_708#All right, Lisa.
S29E11_710#Watch, do not judge.
S29E11_713#What makes him superior?
S29E11_720#I'm okay.
S29E11_724#You have reached the Wiggum residence.
S29E11_726#If Ralph is stuck in something, press one.
S29E11_729#If something is stuck in Ralph, press two.
S29E11_732#If this is Ralph, Daddy is not in the phone.
S29E11_735#Do not open the phone looking for me.
S29E11_737#What are you doing?
S29E11_739#The only thing I'm good at.
S29E11_740#Nothing.
S29E11_741#That tears it.
S29E11_743#We're going to see Professor Frink,
S29E11_745#and find out exactly what happened on that test.
S29E11_748#Got a little present for you, Bart.
S29E11_750#It's called The Bible For The Slow. Mm?
S29E11_753#He's not going to take it.
S29E11_754#Okily-dokily.
S29E11_757#Professor Frink, your stupid test ruined my son's life.
S29E11_760#Hey, that test is like a son to me.
S29E11_761#I raised it from a quiz.
S29E11_763#I've known my son since he was born,
S29E11_765#and he's not anywhere near as stupid
S29E11_768#as your stupid test says he is.
S29E11_771#And if you think so, you're stupid, stupid, stupid!
S29E11_774#Wow, Marge.
S29E11_776#You really love Bart.
S29E11_778#All right, all right, let me recheck it.
S29E11_779#Uh, rechecking, rechecking.
S29E11_781#Put-upon sigh.
S29E11_782#Oivik.
S29E11_784#Rechecking-- ah, here we are.
S29E11_785#Uh, Simpson, B.
S29E11_788#That's not a "B".
S29E11_791#Well, yes, it is, you see, the two--
S29E11_793#oh, my garvik!
S29E11_794#There was a mistake. 
S29E11_796#Well, your son has above-average intelligence.
S29E11_798#You did it, boy.
S29E11_799#No, that just looks like a "B."
S29E11_801#The real unfortunate is H. Simpson.
S29E11_804#I mean, what a clod!
S29E11_806#Worst handwriting and brain in town.
S29E11_809#I'm H. Simpson.
S29E11_811#Oh, well, it's very nice to meet you.
S29E11_812#Would you like some water?
S29E11_814#- Smartwater? - No.
S29E11_817#- Homie, aren't you coming? - Bye-bye.
S29E11_819#I can't. I'll be a laughing stock when everyone finds out
S29E11_822#I'm the stupidest man in town.
S29E11_824#How are they gonna find out?
S29E11_825#I just tweeted it.
S29E11_827#Marge, you have to get ahead of these stories.
S29E11_834#I'm sorry, sir, you belong here.
S29E11_843#Look thou be true.
S29E11_845#Do not give dalliance.
S29E11_847#Too much of the rein.
S29E11_852#Why does Oscar skate in his trash can?
S29E11_854#It makes no sense!
S29E11_857#I'll cheer up here.
S29E11_860#One "Stupid," Please?
S29E11_862#Okay, you gave me $40.
S29E11_864#Here's two dollars back.
S29E11_866#Unless you want splash insurance.
S29E11_868#- How much is that? - Another ten.
S29E11_869#Uh, here's $20.
S29E11_871#And two more for you.
S29E11_878#Insurance doesn't cover entryway splashes.
S29E11_882#Hey, Homer, uh, we was watching Jeopardy!, but, uh,
S29E11_885#tell you what, we'll just talk about shapes and colors now.
S29E11_888#I like blue rectangles.
S29E11_890#Rectangles. You know, Homer.
S29E11_892#The ones with four sides.
S29E11_894#Listen, you.
S29E11_896#I've known my shapes since I was 16!
S29E11_899#Put him down, Homer, and I'll give you a cookie.
S29E11_901#That's a coaster.
S29E11_903#Ooh! Dummy's wising up.
S29E11_905#I'll take the cookie.
S29E11_907#I never thought I'd say this, 
S29E11_909#but I'm too depressed for Moe's.
S29E11_917#Heya, Homer.
S29E11_919#I'm sorry. I know I'm taking up too much of the bed.
S29E11_922#Oh, sweetie.
S29E11_924#What the entire world thinks doesn't affect how I see you.
S29E11_927#Well, how do you see me?
S29E11_930#The hair and body of a dashing Friar Tuck.
S29E11_935#But what about my brains?
S29E11_937#My favorite character in The Wizard of Oz
S29E11_940#was always the Scarecrow.
S29E11_942#I knew it. Thanks to that test,
S29E11_944#you see me as stupid first and Homer third.
S29E11_946#I mean, second.
S29E11_946#I know second.
S29E11_948#I won't let you give up.
S29E11_950#We're going to start improving you.
S29E11_952#Oh, Marge. No one ever did anything useful
S29E11_954#after the age of 39.
S29E11_956#George W. Bush sobered up.
S29E11_957#And became president.
S29E11_959#Too huge mistakes.
S29E11_960#Homie, this whole mix-up happened
S29E11_962#because of your sloppy handwriting.
S29E11_964#We'll start with that, improving your handwriting.
S29E11_968#Right now, my hand just wants to crawl in my pocket and cry.
S29E11_972#Now this hand is jealous.
S29E11_976#I know where this is going.
S29E11_979#Um, I do, too, but you say it first.
S29E11_981#Snuggling.
S29E11_989#What is his secret? What is his secret?!
S29E11_992#I'm going to Dizzyland.
S29E11_1001#Want to see me do a cartwheel?
S29E11_1003#- No! No, no, no! - Good point.
S29E11_1005#On the other hand, whee!
S29E11_1010#Don't worry, Lou, I've seen that in cartoons.
S29E11_1012#Swee'Pea, Mr. Magoo, they were fine.
S29E11_1014#What about Sylvester the Cat?
S29E11_1016#Never be a cat in a cartoon, Lou.
S29E11_1018#Never.
S29E11_1026#The beam must have a fulcrum I can move to
S29E11_1028#that would stabilize it.
S29E11_1029#Think, Lisa, think.
S29E11_1041#Two for two.
S29E11_1045#Young man, didn't I tell you to sit and stay in that house?
S29E11_1048#I thought you were talking to the dog.
S29E11_1049#We don't have a dog.
S29E11_1051#Then what's been pooping in my bedroom?
S29E11_1054#Professor, how on Earth did he get a higher score than me?
S29E11_1058#Okay, Lisa, I am going to give you ten more points
S29E11_1062#for one of the most important skills of all:
S29E11_1065#discovering huge flaws in my test without telling anyone.
S29E11_1069#You mean, after all this, after all I've gone through,
S29E11_1072#you're just gonna fudge my score
S29E11_1074#and I should be happy?
S29E11_1076#Well, after all, that's how I got into, uh...
S29E11_1078#Oh, I can't say it.
S29E11_1079#The lowest of the Ivys.
S29E11_1081#Oh, God, help me-- Cornell!
S29E11_1082#Cornell! God!
S29E11_1083#It's okay, you're fine.
S29E11_1085#Oh, gloyvik.
S29E11_1087#Okay, Homie, buckle up.
S29E11_1090#Because there's no limit to how neat your handwriting can get.
S29E11_1092#Marge, I don't know.
S29E11_1094#You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
S29E11_1098#I'll help you.
S29E11_1103#*My love...*
S29E11_1105#Lisa, turn off that oldies station!
S29E11_1108#*My darl...*
S29E11_1133#Dearest Marjorie,
S29E11_1135#what words are adequate to describe your beauty?
S29E11_1138#Like, a bowling ball, fresh out of a polisher.
S29E11_1141#I've always dreamed
S29E11_1143#Homie would write me cursive love letters.
S29E11_1153#You are as beautiful as your sisters are hideous.
S29E11_1165#Oh, Homie.
S29E11_1168#I'm married to a writer.
S29E11_1169#I really am.
S29E11_1177#Welcome, all of you.
S29E11_1179#You are the chosen people.
S29E11_1181#Chosen to be my slaves.
S29E11_1183#I am no one's slave.
S29E11_1184#Well, doesn't matter what you think.
S29E11_1186#The doors are sealed.
S29E11_1187#Not this one.
S29E11_1190#Wait, wait, you haven't heard about the retirement plan.
S29E11_1192#There isn't one.
S29E11_1194#Fine, I don't need them.
S29E11_1196#I don't need anyone.
S29E11_1202#Oh. Why did you have me go back for your slippers?
S29E11_1205#How could you turn on me so quickly?
