#### Project description
We designed a story generator. In our daily lives, we often encounter the breaking of comics and novels, while sometimes we are not satisfied with the ending arranged by the author. Inspired by the exciting development of AI, we have the idea that, why not design a story teller, and let everyone be a playwright?
